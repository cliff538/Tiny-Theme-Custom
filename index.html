		<a href="https://cliff538.com/2025/01/27/people-pledge-kindness-and-professionalism.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-01-27 14:56:09 -0700">Jan 27, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have a nice little button in the footer of my website called <a href="https://people.pledge.party">The People Pledge</a>. I believe in those words and am constantly striving to fulfill them. However, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about removing that pledge and improving it, making it my own, which would include some essential words like kindness, respect, and love.</p>
<p>In all the big online piss-up last week, some of the things I saw missing were kindness and respect. That pledge says, &ldquo;I commit to treating others fairly.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m not sure I saw that either. But I&rsquo;m just one person. I don&rsquo;t know all the history and nuance of this case, but it was deeply disturbing to me; truthfully, I almost deleted my account, my mastodon, my website, and my online life and ran from what I thought was a good place, and I wasn&rsquo;t even the focus! I can&rsquo;t imagine the pain, hurt, and sleepless nights had by most, if not all, involved. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way.</p>
<p>In my work life, we have a thing called Professional Standards. It&rsquo;s a way to reduce employee friction and leave the company out of the process. It lets employees with some training call each person and get their side of the story, then bring the two people together for a sit-down, phone call, or Zoom to work things out. It&rsquo;s my understanding that the success rate with this is exceptionally high. Things are done with kindness and respect; they are settled among the employees themselves and leave the company and the public out of the process that usually has legal restrictions that may include punishment, etc., that don&rsquo;t need to be if the employees themselves handle it. It&rsquo;s a win-win for everybody. Perhaps even in cases like last week, there could be something of the sort?</p>
<p>People make mistakes. They learn and grow from being called out kindly and gently. I, for one, have come a long, long way in becoming a better human to all. My wife calls me out frequently, and it&rsquo;s painful, but it makes me a better human being. I work in a very diverse company and have respect, love, and kindness for all, but it didn&rsquo;t start out that way, I had some rough edges and needed to learn about things that I knew nothing about. But after 56 years of living, I&rsquo;ve learned that it provokes hostility if it&rsquo;s done with hostility. Does having hundreds of people gang up on you help? Some things, most sensitive things, are better done out of the public view, especially when it&rsquo;s done within your tribe. It&rsquo;s worthwhile to start there and at least try, is it not?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t mean any disrespect to anyone, and I fully admit there is history here that I&rsquo;m not privy to. There are always more sides, hurt feelings, and people involved than I even know, but you can still include kindness and professionalism, especially when you have a People Pledge to follow.</p>
<p>I also understand that some become frustrated by people&rsquo;s actions, especially when directed at an already attacked group, and just don&rsquo;t have the bandwidth for civility or kindness. I&rsquo;ve been there. We are humans and far from perfect. That&rsquo;s why this is just a reminder about civility and kindness. In a world chock full of hate, the thing that we don&rsquo;t need less of is kindness.</p>
<p>The attacks are real, and the hostility is growing by the day with this new administration. Let&rsquo;s work together to do what each of us can. Let&rsquo;s be kind to one another and protect everyone that we can through actions and words.</p>

<p>I used to write/publish photo stories at Exposure.co. It&rsquo;s a nice website, and it&rsquo;s a great place to see other people&rsquo;s work, but it locks your content and locks you into paying every year to have access to your content. I&rsquo;ve had a good engagement over there. I only have four stories there, but they each have 33,000+ views, which is a lot for my work. With that being said, I don&rsquo;t do the things that I do for views, clicks, or money. 
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I&rsquo;ve been moving my digital life to cliff538.com and have downloaded my data for Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Today, I focused on Exposure. How much does it cost a year? Can I download my stories? Do I want this anymore? Keep or delete. 
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Over the years at Exposure I&rsquo;ve been paying $99/year, the lowest tier now is $149/year. I decided to export my content and move it to cliff538.com. Well, guess what, you can&rsquo;t. The only export option is a PDF, only if you pay for Pro Plus, which is $319/year. If I want to export PDFs of my photo stories, I&rsquo;ll have to upgrade my account, download the PDFs, and close my account. But, they throw in some nice warnings; if your stories are over a specific size, you have to be on the business plan at $999/year to export your PDFs. Two, they warn you that the PDFs may not even look good due to pagination issues and that they are working on it. 
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
PDF exports don&rsquo;t help me much because I need to build a web page to recreate my photo stories. This makes me unhappy and reinforces why I&rsquo;m making this move. Own your content, control where it is, and have full backups. Don&rsquo;t be locked into price increases, a lack of export options, or business failures. 
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
So what to do? Well, I&rsquo;m stuck; luckily, there are only four medium-sized stories. I have all the photos; I used Obsidian Web Clipper to clip the pages, which gives me the text between the pictures. Reimagining the stories into web pages for my blog will be time-consuming, but the beauty is that it will be the last time. I&rsquo;ll control how it looks and where it lives.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I thought about just deleting it but the stories really do have meaning for me. They are from a different time in my life. I wouldnt write the stories the same way today or use the same pictures (some of the HDR makes me cringe) but back then I did, and sometimes it&rsquo;s good to see where you came from.

<p>If you’re publishing your work exclusively on platforms like Instagram, Medium, or Facebook, you’re playing by someone else’s rules. While these platforms provide convenience and exposure, they come with significant risks:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Platform Dependency</strong>: What happens if the platform changes its algorithm, shutters its services, or bans your account? In 2024 alone, over 60% of creators reported revenue losses due to algorithm changes.    
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monetization Barriers</strong>: Platforms often take a significant cut of your earnings. For instance, YouTube takes up to 45% of ad revenue, and Instagram&rsquo;s monetization options are pay-to-play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Ownership</strong>: The data you’re generating—your audience insights, contact lists, and engagement metrics—belongs to the platform, not you. They profit from it while you’re left in the dark.    
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Censorship and Restrictions</strong>: Platforms can impose restrictions on what you publish, often limiting creativity and expression. If your content doesn’t align with their guidelines, it can be removed or suppressed.<br>

			 <p>Progress! Added a &ldquo;cliff538 Photography&rdquo; page with links to photo sets (only one set as of now), But I like the way <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> has built this in. You can adjust the photo sets with custom CSS, and the large viewer is really nice. The only set right now is Land Yachts, if you don&rsquo;t know what a Land Yacht is, check it out.</p>

			 <p>Growing up, we rode three-wheelers every day all year long. Over the years, we had the Honda 110, 185, 200, 200X, and finally the 250R, which was scary fast. It was a blast riding on frozen lakes in the winter. I will never forget those times.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In shop class, we learned how to rebuild the motors and, of course, put in higher compression pistons to increase horsepower. Oh, and that dreadful youthful phase of liking loud exhaust pipes&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Our local dealer in town always had brand new ones sitting on the showroom floor, we would go in an and dream about saving enough money from working in the Summer fishing that we could get a new one..</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then, in my twenties, going up North to work, nobody had cars; it was all three-wheelers, four-wheelers, and snowmachines. Honda made the most incredibly reliable engines. People would tear those things up over the years, do very maintenance, and they just kept on going year after year.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was a little sad to watch the three-wheelers phase out and be replaced by the four-wheelers, which were not as fun. I do understand, though. I know the accident rate was high with the three-wheelers, but that was mostly user error, not being properly trained in the limitations and idiosyncrasies of the machine, and riding one way too powerful for your skills. Growing up, with all the riding we all did, nobody was seriously hurt by them, but we had plenty of auto accidents/deaths.</p>
<p>Some final facts from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Honda’s dominance in the ATC market peaked in 1984, with 370,000 units shipped and a 69% market share. In 1985, Honda offered their most diverse lineup, with ten models available. However, due to safety concerns, production of three-wheelers was voluntarily ceased by all manufacturers by 1987. ￼
These models played a significant role in popularizing ATCs and contributed to the development of the modern ATV industry.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is mostly how you find them now:</p>

<p>This has been a struggle for me in the past. I often found myself running out of books and searching for something new to read, which led me to browse bookstores. Each visit is a wonderful experience; independent shops have a unique charm, often showcasing local authors, and the smell of books is irreplaceable. However, there were times when I left empty-handed, without anything that sparked my interest.</p>
<p>To tackle this, having a collection of online tools for discovering books is essential. Here are some ideas that may inspire you.</p>
<p>Now, I face a new challenge: a to-read list that keeps expanding, which is, in fact, a wonderful problem to have. I used to feel overwhelmed by this, but I&rsquo;ve learned to embrace the reality that countless books will always remain out of reach. That’s why it’s so important to focus on reading what you love. Don’t linger on a book that feels just okay; there are countless extraordinary stories waiting for you. And don’t let that ever-growing pile of unread books weigh you down; it’s always there with your next book!</p>
<p>I will continue to add to this list with your suggestions and any helpful resources I come across. Please email or comment with your favorites, and I’ll include them.

<p>These are two of my favorite pictures. I was extremely lucky to be driving down the highway and catch these guys working in the hills. I had my 200-500mm lens, which allowed me to take these shots. It was all shot out the window. I sat there for hours, watching these guys work. I would like to do this after I retire. I respect these pilots greatly. I was able to contact the pilots via social media and made sure they received copies of the prints.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a Waking Up meditation app user, and Sam had a good New Year resolution conceptual frame to place around everything in 2025. I’m paraphrasing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Filter everything you do this year through the lens that this is your last year of life. It’s a clarifier of sorts, a filter for what you will do and not do. Would I do this? Would I care about this? Would I pay attention to this? A great example was, would you take the time to watch a lousy movie alone? Certainly not. How about watching a bad movie with your kids? Absolutely yes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time with family, even during a bad movie, is precious. We will all have our own do’s and don’t do’s, but It struck me and made me think really hard about the things I’m going to do in 2025. </p>
<p>You can listen to the whole 8 min message <a href="https://dynamic.wakingup.com/course/CO284C5?source=content%20share&amp;share_id=6F9A3E1D&amp;code=SC2475C82">here</a>.</p>
<p>Another great post about some life lessons and what you can apply to this new year comes from Maria Popova with her post <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/10/22/marginalian-18/">18 Life-Learnings from 18 Years of the Marginalian</a>.  I love how beautifully she writes. I&rsquo;m striving for many things on her list, like #14, &ldquo;Choose Joy,&rdquo; and #13, &ldquo;In any bond of depth and significance, forgive, forgive, forgive. And then forgive again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wishing you all a fulfilling and productive 2025 filled with joy. Cheers.</p>

<p>Welcome to cliff538.com, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>The scaffolding is up, and the orange cones are out. We are fully under construction (<em>well, aren&rsquo;t we all. It&rsquo;s a process&hellip; even at 55+ years old, I&rsquo;m still under construction</em>). Lots of changes coming as I figure out this Hugo blog generator and dust off some ancient HTML and CSS skills. This is my main landing page and a small blog for everyday stuff (<em>I think, maybe just a landing page. Keep it simple, Cliff&hellip;</em>), along with my micro.blog. The primary blogging will be done over at Exposed To Want.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know about design yet and how this is going to work, but that&rsquo;s half the fun, figuring all this stuff out!</p>
<p>My life quote right now is attributed to Rene Descartes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You just keep pushing. You just keep pushing. I made every mistake that could be made. But I just kept pushing&quot; </p>

Trying to use Apple Intelligence is just not user-friendly, and it doesn&rsquo;t show you what it has changed; it just shows the whole paragraph rewritten, not what has changed. The one stand-out is using ChatGPT through Siri. One, it&rsquo;s free and private if you don&rsquo;t log into your account, and Two, you can log into your account if you have one, and it will log everything in your ChatGPT account for future reference. One nice trick is using ChatGPT through Siri with your voice after you get the response back, you can ask Siri to make a note out of the response so you can refer back to it, or it will disappear. Hopefully, Apple will kick up its adoption speed a notch or two.
