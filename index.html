<p>I used to write/publish photo stories at Exposure.co. It&rsquo;s a nice website, and it&rsquo;s a great place to see other people&rsquo;s work, but it locks your content and locks you into paying every year to have access to your content. I&rsquo;ve had a good engagement over there. I only have four stories there, but they each have 33,000+ views, which is a lot for my work. With that being said, I don&rsquo;t do the things that I do for views, clicks, or money.Â 
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I&rsquo;ve been moving my digital life to cliff538.com and have downloaded my data for Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Today, I focused on Exposure. How much does it cost a year? Can I download my stories? Do I want this anymore? Keep or delete.Â 
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Over the years at Exposure I&rsquo;ve been paying $99/year, the lowest tier now is $149/year. I decided to export my content and move it to cliff538.com. Well, guess what, you can&rsquo;t. The only export option is a PDF, only if you pay for Pro Plus, which is $319/year. If I want to export PDFs of my photo stories, I&rsquo;ll have to upgrade my account, download the PDFs, and close my account. But, they throw in some nice warnings; if your stories are over a specific size, you have to be on the business plan at $999/year to export your PDFs. Two, they warn you that the PDFs may not even look good due to pagination issues and that they are working on it.Â 
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
PDF exports don&rsquo;t help me much because I need to build a web page to recreate my photo stories. This makes me unhappy and reinforces why I&rsquo;m making this move. Own your content, control where it is, and have full backups. Don&rsquo;t be locked into price increases, a lack of export options, or business failures.Â 
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
So what to do? Well, I&rsquo;m stuck; luckily, there are only four medium-sized stories. I have all the photos; I used Obsidian Web Clipper to clip the pages, which gives me the text between the pictures. Reimagining the stories into web pages for my blog will be time-consuming, but the beauty is that it will be the last time.Â I&rsquo;ll control how it looks and where it lives.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I thought about just deleting it but the stories really do have meaning for me. They are from a different time in my life. I wouldnt write the stories the same way today or use the same pictures (some of the HDR makes me cringe) but back then I did, and sometimes it&rsquo;s good to see where you came from.

<h3 id="the-risks-of-relying-on-third-party-platforms"><strong>The Risks of Relying on Third-Party Platforms</strong></h3>
<p>If youâ€™re publishing your work exclusively on platforms like Instagram, Medium, or Facebook, youâ€™re playing by someone elseâ€™s rules. While these platforms provide convenience and exposure, they come with significant risks:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Platform Dependency</strong>: What happens if the platform changes its algorithm, shutters its services, or bans your account? In 2024 alone, over 60% of creators reported revenue losses due to algorithm changes.   Â 
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monetization Barriers</strong>: Platforms often take a significant cut of your earnings. For instance, YouTube takes up to 45% of ad revenue, and Instagram&rsquo;s monetization options are pay-to-play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Ownership</strong>: The data youâ€™re generatingâ€”your audience insights, contact lists, and engagement metricsâ€”belongs to the platform, not you. They profit from it while youâ€™re left in the dark.   Â 
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Censorship and Restrictions</strong>: Platforms can impose restrictions on what you publish, often limiting creativity and expression. If your content doesnâ€™t align with their guidelines, it can be removed or suppressed.<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-benefits-of-owning-your-platform"><strong>The Benefits of Owning Your Platform</strong></h3>
<p>By running your blog or website, you remove the middleman and take full control of your content and audience. Hereâ€™s what you gain:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Full Creative Control</strong>: Publish what you want, how you want, without fear of censorship.   Â </li>
<li><strong>Data Ownership</strong>: Collect and control your audience data directly, enabling better relationships and monetization strategies.   Â </li>
<li><strong>Longevity</strong>: Platforms come and go, but your self-hosted blog can remain online indefinitely, ensuring your creations outlive any trend or corporate decision.   Â </li>
<li><strong>Custom Branding</strong>: Unlike third-party platforms, your blog reflects your unique identity, free from distracting ads or conflicting branding.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="debunking-the-technical-barrier-myth"><strong>Debunking the Technical Barrier Myth</strong></h3>
<p>Many creators hesitate to start their blog because they fear itâ€™s too technical or expensive. This couldnâ€™t be further from the truth. Modern tools like WordPress, Hugo, and Micro.blog make self-hosting more accessible than ever. Hereâ€™s a simple roadmap to get started:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Buy a Domain</strong>: Use a registrar like Hover.com to purchase a custom domain for as little as $10/year.   Â </li>
<li><strong>Choose a Hosting Platform</strong>: Services like SiteGround, Micro.blog, or Netlify offer affordable options.   Â </li>
<li><strong>Start Writing</strong>: With pre-built templates and easy-to-use tools, you can be up and running in a matter of hours.   Â

</ol>
<h3 id="the-numbers-dont-lie"><strong>The Numbers Donâ€™t Lie</strong></h3>
<p>The shift toward self-hosting is gaining momentum:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>45% of creators</strong>Â plan to invest in self-hosted platforms by 2026.   Â </li>
<li><strong>70% of internet users</strong>Â express concerns about how platforms handle their data.   Â </li>
<li><strong>Domain registrations for personal websites</strong>Â rose by 30% in 2023.   Â 
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="call-to-action-own-your-digital-future"><strong>Call to Action: Own Your Digital Future</strong></h3>
<p>Owning your content isnâ€™t just about control; itâ€™s about building a digital future that belongs to you. Stop renting your ideas on platforms that profit from your creativity. Start your own blog today, and take the first step toward true creative independence.

			 <p>Growing up, we rode three-wheelers every day all year long. Over the years, we had the Honda 110, 185, 200, 200X, and finally the 250R, which was scary fast. It was a blast riding on frozen lakes in the winter. I will never forget those times.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In shop class, we learned how to rebuild the motors and, of course, put in higher compression pistons to increase horsepower. Oh, and that dreadful youthful phase of liking loud exhaust pipes&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Our local dealer in town always had brand new ones sitting on the showroom floor, we would go in an and dream about saving enough money from working in the Summer fishing that we could get a new one..</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then, in my twenties, going up North to work, nobody had cars; it was all three-wheelers, four-wheelers, and snowmachines. Honda made the most incredibly reliable engines. People would tear those things up over the years, do very maintenance, and they just kept on going year after year.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was a little sad to watch the three-wheelers phase out and be replaced by the four-wheelers, which were not as fun. I do understand, though. I know the accident rate was high with the three-wheelers, but that was mostly user error, not being properly trained in the limitations and idiosyncrasies of the machine, and riding one way too powerful for your skills. Growing up, with all the riding we all did, nobody was seriously hurt by them, but we had plenty of auto accidents/deaths.</p>
<p>Some final facts from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hondaâ€™s dominance in the ATC market peaked in 1984, with 370,000 units shipped and a 69% market share. In 1985, Honda offered their most diverse lineup, with ten models available. However, due to safety concerns, production of three-wheelers was voluntarily ceased by all manufacturers by 1987. ï¿¼
These models played a significant role in popularizing ATCs and contributed to the development of the modern ATV industry.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is mostly how you find them now:</p>

<p>This has been a struggle for me in the past. I often found myself running out of books and searching for something new to read, which led me to browse bookstores. Each visit is a wonderful experience; independent shops have a unique charm, often showcasing local authors, and the smell of books is irreplaceable. However, there were times when I left empty-handed, without anything that sparked my interest.</p>
<p>To tackle this, having a collection of online tools for discovering books is essential. Here are some ideas that may inspire you.</p>
<p>Now, I face a new challenge: a to-read list that keeps expanding, which is, in fact, a wonderful problem to have. I used to feel overwhelmed by this, but I&rsquo;ve learned to embrace the reality that countless books will always remain out of reach. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s so important to focus on reading what you love. Donâ€™t linger on a book that feels just okay; there are countless extraordinary stories waiting for you. And donâ€™t let that ever-growing pile of unread books weigh you down; itâ€™s always there with your next book!</p>
<p>I will continue to add to this list with your suggestions and any helpful resources I come across. Please email or comment with your favorites, and Iâ€™ll include them.

<p>These are two of my favorite pictures. I was extremely lucky to be driving down the highway and catch these guys working in the hills. I had my 200-500mm lens, which allowed me to take these shots. It was all shot out the window. I sat there for hours, watching these guys work. I would like to do this after I retire. I respect these pilots greatly. I was able to contact the pilots via social media and made sure they received copies of the prints.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a Waking Up meditation app user, and Sam had a good New Year resolution conceptual frame to place around everything in 2025. Iâ€™m paraphrasing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Filter everything you do this year through the lens that this is your last year of life. Itâ€™s a clarifier of sorts, a filter for what you will do and not do. Would I do this? Would I care about this? Would I pay attention to this? A great example was, would you take the time to watch a lousy movie alone? Certainly not. How about watching a bad movie with your kids? Absolutely yes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time with family, even during a bad movie, is precious. We will all have our own doâ€™s and donâ€™t doâ€™s, but It struck me and made me think really hard about the things Iâ€™m going to do in 2025.Â </p>
<p>You can listen to the whole 8 min message <a href="https://dynamic.wakingup.com/course/CO284C5?source=content%20share&amp;share_id=6F9A3E1D&amp;code=SC2475C82">here</a>.</p>
<p>Another great post about some life lessons and what you can apply to this new year comes from Maria Popova with her post <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/10/22/marginalian-18/">18 Life-Learnings from 18 Years of the Marginalian</a>.  I love how beautifully she writes. I&rsquo;m striving for many things on her list, like #14, &ldquo;Choose Joy,&rdquo; and #13, &ldquo;In any bond of depth and significance, forgive, forgive, forgive. And then forgive again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wishing you all a fulfilling and productive 2025 filled with joy. Cheers.</p>

<p>Welcome to cliff538.com, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>The scaffolding is up, and the orange cones are out. We are fully under construction (<em>well, aren&rsquo;t we all. It&rsquo;s a process&hellip; even at 55+ years old, I&rsquo;m still under construction</em>). Lots of changes coming as I figure out this Hugo blog generator and dust off some ancient HTML and CSS skills. This is my main landing page and a small blog for everyday stuff (<em>I think, maybe just a landing page. Keep it simple, Cliff&hellip;</em>), along with my micro.blog. The primary blogging will be done over at Exposed To Want.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know about design yet and how this is going to work, but that&rsquo;s half the fun, figuring all this stuff out!</p>
<p>My life quote right now is from Rene Descartes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>â€œYou just keep pushing. You just keep pushing. I made every mistake that could be made. But I just kept pushing&quot;Â </p>
</blockquote>

The M4 chip and the Retina XDR display at 1000/1600 nits is just beautiful. I&rsquo;ve had zero performance issues using FCP or editing pictures. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve never used a keyboard with an iPad before and was pretty skeptical. I forced myself to keep it attached for 30 days, and now I can&rsquo;t imagine using the iPad without it. It&rsquo;s a perfect built-in stand, and for reading in bed using the iPad in a vertical position, I can use the keyboard as a light-blocking aid. I find myself using the iPad way more at home for writing than the laptop. But, there have been some awkward moments using the laptop after the iPad and trying to touch the screen&hellip;</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone 16 Pro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is worth it just for the big bump in battery life, especially if you&rsquo;ll shoot a lot of video.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Inteligence<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, meh. I&rsquo;m not using it much. As I&rsquo;ve talked about before, I&rsquo;m a terrible writer, and I use Grammarly extensively to fix my horrible punctuation, spelling, and structure. Trying to use Apple Intelligence is just not user-friendly, and it doesn&rsquo;t show you what it has changed; it just shows the whole paragraph rewritten, not what has changed. The one stand-out is using ChatGPT through Siri. One, it&rsquo;s free and private if you don&rsquo;t log into your account, and Two, you can log into your account if you have one, and it will log everything in your ChatGPT account for future reference. One nice trick is using ChatGPT through Siri with your voice after you get the response back, you can ask Siri to make a note out of the response so you can refer back to it, or it will disappear. Hopefully, Apple will kick up its adoption speed a notch or two.

<li>Find a new second monitor. I&rsquo;m using a Studio Display as the main display, and I have a now very old 30&quot; Apple Cinema Display that still surprises me that it still works. It&rsquo;s around 17 years old. Doing a lot of tutorials and video/photo editing, the second monitor is priceless.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>Read and support more small independent news sources like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->404 Media<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the numerous independent journalists on Substack. There is a wave of exodus of talent from major news outlets now that they can make a living writing on Substack, Beehiiv, Ghost, etc. That freedom to say what you want when you want has got to be refreshing. We are experiencing significant changes in mainstream media, and I believe 2025 will be a very tumultuous year. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
