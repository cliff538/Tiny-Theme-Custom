			 <p>I know, way too many posts out there about AI Agents making apps. But, in my opinion, this is what they are for. My coding skills are at a hobby level, and now I can code using English, and it&rsquo;s really fast and really good.</p>
<p>Today, &ldquo;we&rdquo; made an online Cliff538 Status Board web app. Not a single mistake was made; it went very smoothly. The only changes were asking whether certain APIs allowed more information to be displayed, and cosmetic changes to improve the look. I have a spare iPad on my desktop that keeps the page up and refreshing for me. Overkill, I know, but it&rsquo;s a hobby. It&rsquo;s damn fun.</p>
<p>It refreshes every 30 seconds, runs locally on my Mac Mini, and is accessed using Tailscale.</p>
<p>I love it.</p>
<p>I can see more custom apps in my near future. This really cements the purchase of the Mac Mini as a home server; this web app running locally hardly uses any resources. &ldquo;We&rdquo; code locally on my office Mac and push to GitHub, then I screen share into the mini and have it download changes from GitHub. It&rsquo;s a very nice system.</p>
<p>I will soon investigate <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a> as an option for a VPS.</p>
<p>Lately, another good use for Claude/ChatGPT has been to upload my HTML and CSS files for cleanup, commenting, adding a nice Table of Contents, etc. It makes me feel better to have my personal blog web pages neat and organized.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s it until the next web app or, hopefully, an iPhone app soon. I&rsquo;ve taken many <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com">courses</a> on iOS apps and Swift, and it never clicked for me; it&rsquo;s a very hard language. I much more enjoy Python, HTML, CSS, and some JS. Excited to see how Claude and I work together on that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a wonderful day futzing with this.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t have you check out the live web app because it&rsquo;s not on the internet, just on my Tailscale Network, but here is a screenshot:</p>

<p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780399563430">The Morning Star</a> by Karl Ove Knausgaard 📚</p>
<p>What can I say about this book&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m staring at a blinking cursor for what seems like hours, because I don&rsquo;t know how to approach writing about it. I&rsquo;m not as gifted with words as the author is.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a powerful book, beautifully crafted, masterfully written. It haunts you when you aren&rsquo;t reading it. It draws you back to it, into the book. You don&rsquo;t just read it, you step inside the pages and experience it.</p>
<p>It starts off so mundane and ordinary, and the only reason you keep reading is how well it&rsquo;s written and how well the characters are unfolded into the story. You find yourself saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to know this much backstory about this guy.&rdquo; But you do. As this story unfolds, it brings you to places you&rsquo;ve never been before. I promise you.</p>
<p>This is not a book for everyone, but I suggest you start it and see what you think. I don&rsquo;t know anything about Karl Ove Knausgaard, but I&rsquo;ll be looking him up and stepping into his next book. He is clearly a gifted writer and a deep thinker. I don&rsquo;t even remember what brought me to the book, but it&rsquo;s been sitting in my To-Read pile for some time now. I thought it would be a book I&rsquo;d read a few chapters of and move on.</p>
<p>When I wasn&rsquo;t reading it, I was thinking about it. That is about the highest praise I can give a writer.</p>
<p>A shoutout to the translator, Martin Aitken. I don&rsquo;t know if this book reads as beautifully in Norwegian as it does in English, but what a job it is to translate what the author wrote and felt and meant into another language.</p>
<p>This book takes mundane, ordinary people with ordinary problems and brings them alive, steps you into their world and beyond into existential questions about mortality and the afterlife. What it means to be alive. What life is about and what the bonds of family and friendship really mean.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if I need a break before book two of the series, maybe a palate cleanser. I feel like my brain needs a break, but at the same time, I don&rsquo;t want to leave the world of Knausgaard. I&rsquo;ve taken a quick peek at the reviews of book two, and it seems to be loved even more than book one. It seems Karl has really hit his stride with the second book. I&rsquo;ve taken a full day off from reading and think I will jump right into it.</p>
<p>I have to mention the last chapter. Starting it, you think you&rsquo;re done with the book, that the author is just giving you some research and backstory on the book. But halfway through, it ties right back into our characters and throws you back for even thinking the story was over. There are so many surprises in this book; it is so well written, you just have to experience it. I can see how some say it&rsquo;s too slow. Enjoy the slow, enjoy the beautifully placed words side by side, weaving a masterful story together. Leave time behind and enter the story with the characters. Take a moment and look up into the heavens and gaze at the new star.</p>
<p><em>Random Thoughts:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I wish I were fluent in Norwegian just so I could read this book in its original language. How is it different? How has the meaning changed? Is it as powerful and beautiful? How did Aitken, the translator, approach the translation?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who is Karl Ove Knausgaard? How long has he been writing? How did he learn to write like this? How much of his craft was natural vs blood, sweat, and tears of years of writing and re-writing? How long did it take him to write this book? How many pages were rewritten over and over again?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How did he meet his translator? How close are they? Does Karl interfere with or &ldquo;suggest&rdquo; changes to the translations?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Not sure about all of this, but it bothers me that titleless short notes, really meant for Mastodon, are clogging up my home page.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still investigating whether there is a way to separate titleless posts from the home page, but then you would still need a separate page to show all of them. Or, have a toggle to show/hide. Seems complex to me.</p>
<p>The easiest route is what most people suggested to me: just keeping everything on one blog. Keep it simple! I tried posting my short notes only to Mastodon, but then I don&rsquo;t have a nice, clean running record on my blog. The answer seems to be a separate blog where you write all your short notes, tweets, skeets, and toots. Then you have a clean running list of all of them. Link to it from the home page.</p>
<p>Most people will never look at it; it&rsquo;s mostly for me. A record of everything I posted to Mastodon. I suppose you could download all that info from Masto, but what then? Where do you put it for easy viewing?</p>
<p>We will try this for a few months and see how I like it. It&rsquo;s easy to go back to having everything on the home page.</p>

			 <p>How do you handle your short, title less posts?</p>
<p>Just keep them on your main blog?</p>
<p>Have a separate blog just for short posts, and link to it on your main blog?</p>
<p>If you keep them on your main blog, do you somehow separate them out? Does your theme give you that ability or have you coded this option in?</p>

			 <p>I’m not sure why I’m so drawn to writers, other than it’s a skill that I don’t have in any form. Writers have dedicated their lives to crafting words together to tell a story that a reader can understand, identify with, sympathize with, even to the point of changing the life of that reader. The person that I am today is partly shaped by books that I&rsquo;ve read.</p>
<p>This interview with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/10/magazine/george-saunders-interview.html?unlocked_article_code=1.DVA.O0pu.BO50mlQD6wql&amp;smid=nytcore-ios-share">George Saunders</a> is a real treat.</p>
<p>George says;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s this Chekhov quote that I’m kind of living by lately. He says a work of art doesn’t have to solve a problem — it just has to formulate it correctly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree, the start of solving a problem is truly identifying what the problem is. To formulate it correctly. To put it into words that can be understood. This is a skill. I see it in my own life in relationships. I complain about something and talk about the problem, but it comes across wrong to the other person, they don&rsquo;t understand, or they offer a solution to the problem they perceive I&rsquo;m talking about. I&rsquo;m failing to formulate my problem correctly.</p>
<p>The art of good writing will never cease to amaze me and even though I can&rsquo;t write, I sure can appreciate it, and read as much of it as I can until my dying day.</p>
<p>Anyway, really good interview. Read it or even better watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/wGWCqgIyrbM?si=DeXccpnMVP-inCQT">video</a>.</p>

<p>Powerful book, makes you think a lot about the human condition, how we treat each other, and the assumptions we make. Intelligence or the lack of it, and how differently we treat people with the whatever level we think they have.</p>
<p>Good story, powerful character building.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I know now there’s one thing you’ve all overlooked: intelligence and education that hasn’t been tempered by human affection isn’t worth a damn.”</p>

			 <h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>You can see my 2025 reading list <a href="https://cliff538.com/2026/01/01/year-in-books-for.html">here</a> and <a href="https://cliff538.com/reading/">here</a>. I always strive to keep my reading diverse, to avoid locking into one genre. I think I&rsquo;m doing pretty well here. I’m trying to read a classic, some history, adventure, fantasy, sci-fi, and keep things well-rounded. There are so many incredible books out there to explore. One of the many reasons why a person wishes they could live longer.</p>
<p>My far-and-away favorite this year was Raising Hare by Chloe Dalton. I will reread this book. Cabin by Patrick Hutchison was hilarious, and I could identify with so many things. A Marriage at Sea was an incredible survival story. Nothing needs to be said about Everything is Tuberculosis by John Green, just read it. Nuclear War was fascinating. Sorkin’s 1929 was a great story about the 1929 Stock Market crash, so many things appear to be happening again, just saying. How To Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia and The Immortalists were both excellent.</p>
<p>I had two <a href="https://cliff538.com/reading/">DNF</a> (Did Not Finish) books this year, both titled Dominion, nothing bad about them, maybe just the timing and not being in the mood for the subjects.</p>
<p>Because of my weekly travel, I predominantly read digital books, which keeps my bags small and lets me read several at once. The added benefit of syncing all my notes and highlights to <a href="https://readwise.io">ReadWise</a> is worth mentioning. I&rsquo;m a big believer in going back and reading highlights and notes from past reads. I do this every morning with an automatic email from ReadWise. It keeps your past books and the knowledge gained from them fresh.</p>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<h3 id="highlights">Highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>My first time upgrading Hard Drives in my Synology NAS. A slightly nerve-wrenching process that, so far (doing my 3rd drive now), is going very well. Each drive takes about 2 days to repair. I’m switching from my current 6TB drives to 16 TB drives.</li>
<li>I did a <a href="https://cliff538.com/2025/12/29/setting-up-a-mac-mini.html">Mac Mini Server Project</a> that was a lot of fun putting together. I learned a lot about TailScale, VPNs, Subnets, LANs, WANs, and SMB connections.  The learning will continue as I keep adding things to this setup.</li>
<li>I did a huge email reset this year. You can read about it <a href="https://cliff538.com/2025/12/23/lets-talk-email-ive-never.html">here</a>. It&rsquo;s a hell of a process changing your emails over. I&rsquo;m many weeks into it, and I&rsquo;m still changing emails. It&rsquo;s going to take six months as things trickle in. It&rsquo;s amazing how many accounts one has. On the bright side, this should be the last time. Frustrating to run across services that will not allow you to change your email unless you make a new account, losing all your data from the old account.</li>
<li>My big battle right now is blog writing and what works best for me. I’m using Drafts and Craft right now, and there are pros and cons to each one. I have also experimented with just using Obsidian, which I already use, and Ulysses is not a slouch either. Almost too many choices! I keep telling myself: keep things simple. You don’t always have to chase the new hip software.</li>
<li>My learning Hugo blogging engine and working locally will be a big ongoing <a href="https://cliff538.com/2026/01/01/working-with-hugo-and-your.html">project</a> for 2026.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="software--apps">Software &amp; Apps</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chirp-ai-for-watch/id6739791292">Chirp</a> A.I. for your Apple Watch. I didn’t know I needed this, but it fills a niche that works very well for me. It has a very generous free plan that I’ve never exceeded.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.futureme.org">FutureMe</a> - I love this service, and I think you should consider using it. Write yourself a letter that shows up to your future self. I’ve sent one to myself on the day that I retire and on future birthdays.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/otaviocc/Triton/releases/tag/1.5.0">Triton</a> - an app by <a href="https://otavio.lol">Otavio</a> for using <a href="https://home.omg.lol">Omg.lol</a> services. Great resource if you use Omg.</li>
<li><a href="https://micro.blog/about/blogging">Micro.blog</a> -  I&rsquo;m very pleased with my choice of blog hosting and all the many other services it provides.</li>
<li><a href="https://tinylytics.app">Tinylytics</a> - Use this service for my blog data, and it has been rock solid.</li>
<li><a href="https://home.omg.lol">Omg.lol</a> - is where I host my about page, and I&rsquo;m slowly adding pictures to their <a href="https://some.pics">some.pics</a> service. Many great resources here, including blogging and lots more.</li>
</ul>
<p>No changes to my daily drivers of Obsidian, DEVONthink, and DayOne. I did do a month-long test of Apple’s Journal App and came right back to DayOne, it&rsquo;s the GOAT. I’ve started using VS Code for programming because of its integration with Claude Code, which has been a fantastic resource for learning more advanced CSS, Git, and GitHub features. You can read some more about that <a href="https://cliff538.com/2026/01/01/working-with-hugo-and-your.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h3>
<p>Always a hot topic. On my short list is to compile a list of all my subscriptions, and I’m sure’ll be aghast at what I’m spending per month. If anything makes you simplify your online and app usage, it will be that monthly number. You can read some good subscription reset blog posts <a href="https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/999month-2024-edition">here</a> and <a href="https://birchtree.me/blog/my-subscription-reset/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Should make for an interesting blog post.</p>
<h3 id="365pixels">365Pixels</h3>
<p>I’m going to keep this going for another year. 2025 was an experiment, and I wasn’t sure I’d keep going, but I’ve enjoyed the process of learning and pushing myself to take daily photos and post them. Photography is a hobby, but it’s also a passion and something I want to improve at continually. The discipline of Daily photos is a great way to push that craft.</p>
<p>I wrote this on my January 1st Photo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2025 was my first year doing a 365 blog. It took a while to get into the swing; I missed 63 days. It has been a lot of fun, and I’m energized to start 2026 with new photography habits and flows to have a better year and reduce that missed-day count.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing about looking back at old photos is seeing how your style has changed. I cringe at some of my old HDR photos, CRISPY! We evolve our skills, our style, our processing techniques. It’s an entertaining and challenging journey.</p>
<h2 id="flying">Flying</h2>
<p>It was another busy year; business is good, and I’m very thankful for that. People flying places pay my bills.</p>
<p>I use the App <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flighty-live-flight-tracker/id1358823008">Flighty</a> to track my flying. I try to keep it updated, and it&rsquo;s pretty close. I do miss putting some flights in, but it&rsquo;s an interesting recap of my yearly flying.</p>
<ul>
<li>236 Flights</li>
<li>203,835 Miles Flown, that’s 8.2 times around the world.</li>
<li>22 Days and 23 Hours in the air.</li>
<li>55 Airports</li>
<li>3 Different Airlines</li>
</ul>
<p>If you travel a lot, I highly recommend you use Flighty. It’s a fantastic resource for all things aviation travel-related.</p>
<p>As I get closer to retirement, I’m eight years away, it’s always a mental battle about working more or less, taking on new roles, and giving up some of what I already do. The older I get, the harder it is to be away from home.</p>
<h2 id="media">Media</h2>
<h3 id="movies--tv">Movies &amp; TV</h3>
<ul>
<li>Common Side Effects - an animated show on HBO Max, I just loved this series. Highly recommend.</li>
<li>Stranger Things - Big fan of all five seasons. Looking forward to the spin-offs. Netflix.</li>
<li>Splinter Cell - I played this video game as a kid, and watching the Netflix animated show has been nostalgic.</li>
<li>The New Yorker at 100 - Watching behind the scenes as The New Yorker makes an issue. Loved it. You can watch it on Netflix.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="blogs">Blogs</h3>
<p>I won’t list out the top blogs that I follow because they’re constantly changing. I love keeping up with people’s blogs and their writings, but man, oh man, have I hit peak overload. I’m maxed out. I don’t have time in the day to keep up with everything that I want to. I’ve tried RSS readers, email, and keeping tabs open. It’s a time issue, so you try your best.</p>
<p>The ones I really value, I have sent to my email, and that seems to work best, followed by using the <a href="https://readwise.io/read">Reader App</a> for RSS feeds.</p>
<h3 id="social-media">Social Media</h3>
<p>I’m keeping it pretty simple here, and I don’t have any fundamental changes for 2026 except for figuring out BlueSky. I’m just using <a href="https://micro.blog/about/blogging">Microblog</a> and <a href="https://thecanadian.social/@Cliff538">Mastodon</a>. I cross-post to BlueSky, but I just never use it.</p>
<p>My photography is on my two blogs, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/cliff538/">Flickr</a>, <a href="https://pixelfed.social/cliff538">PixelFed</a>, and on <a href="https://home.omg.lol">Omg.lol’s</a> <a href="https://cliff538.some.pics">somepics</a>. I’ve resisted the change to other services. If anything, I need to reduce. <a href="https://glass.photo">Glass</a> always tempts me; it&rsquo;s a beautiful service.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>
<p>In closing, it was a good year in the Cliff538 microcosm. Health is becoming a bigger issue every year I get older. Numbers that should be steady are slowly creeping up, and it&rsquo;s a continual battle to eat better, be more active, and get them back down.
I have several very good friends, a fantastic wife, and an outstanding job that I still love going to. My life is only enriched by my connections on Mastodon and my blogs. Thank you for reading, and I wish you an excellent 2026. If you&rsquo;ve written your 2025 recap, please send it to me. I&rsquo;d love to read it.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

			 <h3 id="working-with-hugo-and-your-microblog-locally-with-claude-code-for-testing-and-learning">Working with Hugo and your MicroBlog Locally with Claude Code for Testing and Learning</h3>
<p>There was some discussion about learning Hugo and making your own Theme for your Micro.blog. I&rsquo;d love to do this as well and thought I would dive in and share the progress I&rsquo;ve made so far.</p>
<p>I will strive to update this post with my learning Hugo journey. If it turns into something more, I may make it a dedicated Page on my blog instead of a Post.</p>
<p><strong>Note: I&rsquo;m a hobbyist programmer with 2 years of college programming in C++ and many online classes with Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I&rsquo;ve produced one fully functioning Python web app where pilots could drop their logbook of flying for the year, and it would generate a map of all their travels. I&rsquo;ll note that was before any A.I., so it was hard-won with lots of research and studying!</strong></p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve taken long breaks from my programming hobby, which means I forget a lot of what I&rsquo;ve learned and have to start over.</strong></p>
<p><strong>All that to say, I don&rsquo;t know much, just enough to be dangerous. Use anything I say with caution. My technical terms will probably be wrong, and my approach will probably be the hardest or the worst, or both!</strong></p>
<p>This will not be an exact step-by-step guide, but it will be enough to get you going with one way to do things. As you will see, Claude will give you the step-by-step.</p>
<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>I love tweaking my two blogs, mostly with custom CSS, but I have expanded into the guts of Hugo (the blogging engine) to alter posts with additional data. I love learning, and I love understanding how things work and why.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done extensive custom CSS with Cliff538, all within MicroBlogs' online interface, and it is very dangerous to do it this way. It may be a function of using Safari with so many tabs open, but typing, cutting, pasting, and making a page active, my cursor can lag and jump around. I&rsquo;ve had some terrible incidents where I&rsquo;ve deleted stuff I didn&rsquo;t mean to or copied/pasted that didn&rsquo;t work right. All this to say it&rsquo;s better to do your work in an IDE with a Hugo Server running, so you can see your changes. No weirdness, no risk of messing with your actual blog until you know everything works. Plus, working locally lets you use version control—big win.</p>
<p>Now, with ChatGPT or Claude, you can have assistance and a teacher with precisely what you want to do and learn. This is what A.I. is for, in my opinion. If you can understand Hugo from reading the docs, I&rsquo;m jealous. I&rsquo;m a reader, but I need to see it in action and have someone explain the why to me. This is where Claude and Claude Code come in.</p>
<h3 id="how">How?</h3>
<h4 id="things-you-need">Things you need</h4>
<ul>
<li>Homebrew or other package manager.</li>
<li>An Anthropic account and sign up for their Pro Plan, it&rsquo;s $17/month, and notably includes usage of Claude Code</li>
<li>Download and open the Claude App</li>
<li>VS Code or other IDE. VS Code is ideal because Claude Code integrates with it.</li>
<li>Download your MicroBlog blog&rsquo;s data</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-process">The Process</h3>
<p>Open the Claude App, make a new Project so you can reference it later, and I believe this helps with memory also, and type in a prompt, something like what I did.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext">My blogs are at Micro.blog service. I use their online code interface 
to work on my code, but I don&#39;t want to do this anymore. 
How can I connect my current blog code to a GitHub repository 
to experiment with changes, or start a blank Hugo blog and learn 
to customize my own theme? I want to use Claude Code with VS Code. 
I want to use Git and GitHub for local and cloud version control. 
I want step-by-step instructions and explanations for why we are doing each step. 
My blog, Cliff538, currently uses Tiny Theme.

</code></pre></div><p><strong>Now, you can stop reading here and follow what Claude says.</strong> It brought me to the point of having my exact current blog running locally on my Mac. I make HTML/CSS changes and watch them live. When I&rsquo;m happy with the changes, I save them locally with Git, and at the end of the day, I upload changes to GitHub for safekeeping in a private repository. Then, as of now, I copy and paste my changes into my actual blog. I haven’t researched whether you can connect a GitHub account to your active blog and how quickly it syncs. That may be the next step in the process.</p>
<p>Anytime you don&rsquo;t understand something or why, stop and ask Claude. It explains everything to you (hopefully correctly). This is not an exercise in Claude just doing all these things, unless you want that. <strong>Use Claude as a teacher.</strong></p>
<h3 id="tips-and-suggestions-working-with-claude-and-claude-code">Tips and Suggestions Working With Claude and Claude Code</h3>
<ul>
<li>Claude App is totally separate from Claude Code. You can use both at the same time. Claude Code lives in your Terminal App or within VS Code and is activated and shut down separately from the Claude App. There are more limitations on usage with Claude Code, so use the Claude App for general questions.</li>
<li>Use lots of screenshots. I probably sent Claude 30 different screenshots so it could see what the problem was, it’s easier than explaining it. It works very well.</li>
<li>You can permit Claude Code to modify files within a folder. This worked very well for me when fixing errors. I would let CC fix them, then explain to me why. You can look at the code being altered and ask questions. Git is very handy here; you can open a split screen and see the changes being made.</li>
<li>Anthropic has a page where you can see your Current Session and Weekly Limits. Watch this to learn how many tokens you are using. You can always upgrade your plan or allow Extra Usage. So far, I haven’t bumped up against any limits yet.</li>
<li>Be as detailed as you can with questions, send screenshots, and if you don’t understand something, ask, then continue. Use the teacher that you are paying for.</li>
<li>If Claude gives you instructions to work on the command line and you are not comfortable doing that, ask for an alternative way. It’s just an LLM; you tell it what you want.</li>
<li>I haven’t had to tell Claude to slow down and think longer yet, but working with ChatGPT, I’d get clearly wrong answers, and it would be off track from the question asked. I would have to say, “Stop, look at the question, slow down, and think longer on the problem”. It would help. But so far, Claude has been outstanding.</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Continuing with my process, this will be a lot of pasted instructions from Claude. To give you an idea of the workflow. This is not a linear how-to, just an example.  Scroll to the very bottom for a summary of this first step of learning.</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="exporting-your-current-microblog-sites">Exporting Your Current Micro.blog Sites</h3>
<p>In Micro.blog, go to &lsquo;Design&rsquo;, click on the 3 dots next to your domain name, then click &ldquo;Export&rdquo; and download your &ldquo;Theme and Markdown&rdquo; as a &ldquo;.zip”. This gives you both your content and your current theme.</p>
<p><strong>Important note about photos</strong>: If you have posts with photos, you&rsquo;ll need to replace the URLs as they don&rsquo;t work correctly and won&rsquo;t have been downloaded - you can go through each post and add your domain to the front of each URL.</p>
<h4 id="github-experimental-repository__-recommended-for-learning">GitHub Experimental Repository__ (Recommended for learning)</h4>
<p>This approach lets you experiment safely while keeping your live sites on Micro.blog:</p>
<p><strong>Set up a local Hugo site on your Mac</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">brew install hugo

be custom CSS changes. I would like to use Claude Code so I can 
learn how to use it. Please guide me through the process please.

</code></pre></div><p>Perfect! Let&rsquo;s get you set up with a local Hugo environment that matches your live blogs, and we&rsquo;ll use Claude Code to help manage everything. I&rsquo;ll walk you through this step-by-step.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-install-required-software">Step 1: Install Required Software</h3>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s make sure you have everything installed on your Mac:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#75715e"># Install Hugo if you haven&#39;t already</span>
brew install hugo

<span style="color:#75715e"># Install Claude Code</span>
brew install --cask claude-code

<span style="color:#75715e"># Verify installations</span>
hugo version
claude --version

</code></pre></div><h3 id="step-2-choose-which-blog-to-set-up-first">Step 2: Choose Which Blog to Set Up First</h3>
<p>Since you have two blogs (365pixels.xyz for photos and cliff538.com for general posts), let&rsquo;s start with one. Which would you like to work on first? I&rsquo;d suggest starting with whichever one you want to customize the CSS for most urgently.</p>
<p>For this guide, I&rsquo;ll use <strong>365pixels.xyz</strong> as the example, but the process is identical for cliff538.com.</p>
<h3 id="step-3-create-your-local-hugo-site">Step 3: Create Your Local Hugo Site</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#75715e"># Create a directory for your blog projects</span>
mkdir ~/hugo-blogs
cd ~/hugo-blogs

<span style="color:#75715e"># Create a new Hugo site</span>
hugo new site 365pixels-local
cd 365pixels-local

</code></pre></div><h3 id="step-4-extract-and-copy-your-microblog-export">Step 4: Extract and Copy Your Micro.blog Export</h3>
<ol>
<li>Find your downloaded .zip file from Micro.blog (probably in your Downloads folder)</li>
<li>Extract it</li>
<li>Now let&rsquo;s copy the files into your Hugo site:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#75715e"># Navigate to where you extracted the Micro.blog files</span>
<span style="color:#75715e"># Then copy them to your Hugo site</span>

<span style="color:#75715e"># Copy content</span>
cp -r /path/to/extracted/microblog/content ~/hugo-blogs/365pixels-local/

<span style="color:#75715e"># Copy data folder if it exists</span>
cp -r /path/to/extracted/microblog/data ~/hugo-blogs/365pixels-local/

<span style="color:#75715e"># Copy static files (images, CSS, etc.)</span>
cp -r /path/to/extracted/microblog/static ~/hugo-blogs/365pixels-local/

<span style="color:#75715e"># Copy the theme</span>
cp -r /path/to/extracted/microblog/themes/* ~/hugo-blogs/365pixels-local/themes/

</code></pre></div><h3 id="step-5-convert-and-copy-configuration">Step 5: Convert and Copy Configuration</h3>
<p>Your Micro.blog export includes a <code>config.json</code> file, but Hugo typically uses <code>config.toml</code> or <code>hugo.toml</code>. Let&rsquo;s handle this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">cd ~/hugo-blogs/365pixels-local

</code></pre></div><p>Now, open the <code>config.json</code> from your export and we&rsquo;ll need to convert it. Can you paste the contents of your <code>config.json</code> file here? I&rsquo;ll help you convert it to the proper format.</p>
<h3 id="step-6-initialize-git-and-start-claude-code">Step 6: Initialize Git and Start Claude Code</h3>
<p>Once we have the config sorted:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#75715e"># Initialize git repository</span>
git init

<span style="color:#75715e"># Create a .gitignore file</span>

</span><span style="color:#e6db74"># Hugo cache
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">.hugo_build.lock
</span><span style="color:#e6db74">EOF</span>

<span style="color:#75715e"># Make initial commit</span>
git add .
git commit -m <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Initial commit: Imported from Micro.blog&#34;</span>

<span style="color:#75715e"># Now start Claude Code</span>
claude

</code></pre></div><h3 id="step-7-working-with-claude-code">Step 7: Working with Claude Code</h3>
<p>When Claude Code starts, you&rsquo;ll see a command prompt. Here&rsquo;s how to use it effectively:</p>
<p><strong>First, give Claude Code context:</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext">This is my 365pixels.xyz photo blog imported from Micro.blog. It uses Hugo and I want to:
1. Make sure it runs locally and matches my live site
2. Experiment with custom CSS changes
3. Learn how Hugo themes work

Can you first analyze the structure and tell me what theme I&#39;m using and where the CSS files are located?
</code></pre></div><p><strong>Claude Code will explore your files and report back.</strong> It can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read your config file</li>
<li>Check which theme you&rsquo;re using</li>
<li>Locate CSS files</li>
<li>Identify any issues</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Then ask it to test the site:</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext">Can you help me start the Hugo server and check if there are any errors?
</code></pre></div><p>Claude Code will run <code>hugo server</code> for you and diagnose any problems.</p>
<h3 id="step-8-fixing-photo-urls-important">Step 8: Fixing Photo URLs (Important!)</h3>
<p>Remember, Micro.blog exports don&rsquo;t include the full photo URLs. You&rsquo;ll need to fix these. With Claude Code, you can ask:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-plaintext" data-lang="plaintext">My posts have photo URLs that are incomplete. They need my domain prepended. 
Can you find all image references in my markdown files and update them 
to include https://365pixels.xyz at the beginning?

</code></pre></div><h3 id="what-to-do-next">What to Do Next</h3>
<p>Before I continue with more detailed CSS customization guidance, let&rsquo;s make sure you get through these initial steps.</p>
<p><strong>Can you:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Run through Steps 1-4 above</li>
<li>Share your <code>config.json</code> contents so I can help convert it</li>
<li>Let me know which blog you want to start with</li>
<li>Tell me if you encounter any issues during installation</li>
</ol>
<p>Once we have your local site running and matching your live site, we&rsquo;ll use Claude Code to help you experiment with CSS changes in a really efficient way!</p>
<p>Does this plan work for you? Any questions before you get started?</p>
<p>Excellent! Tiny Theme is developed by Matt Langford and is designed to be as fast as possible while supporting all features of Micro.blog and popular plugins, and is the easiest theme to customize on the platform <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices">Anthropic</a>. Let&rsquo;s get it installed!</p>

<p>Save the <code>hugo.toml</code> file I created earlier (from the artifact above) as <code>hugo.toml</code> in your <code>cliff538-local</code> directory. Then add this line to it:</p>

</code></pre></div><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>OK, you get the idea here. You’ll get your information from MicroBlog and insert it into the proper directories, then start the Hugo Server. If you’re like me, you’ll have 3 or 4 errors, and your site won’t load. Screenshot your errors and give them to Claude. You’ll get detailed instructions on how to fix them.</p>
<p>Once I had my site up and running locally, I opened VS Code and activated Claude Code. This way, you can look directly at your files and Claude Code on one screen. It’s invaluable. I haven’t used VS Code very much at all. Claude will tell you how to set it up, which packages to download, and how to configure the perfect Hugo development environment. If you don’t understand something, ask.</p>
<p>I asked a ton of questions about how Git and GitHub worked within VS Code and what all the red and green bars meant. It was all new to me. If I were working with somebody, they would have fired me and walked out of the room in disgust with all the questions! LOL.</p>
<p>When things are set up, you have a basic understanding of working with VS Code and Claude Code, you can get down to the business of tweaking, learning, and experimenting. You can ask Claude Code what problems do  you see with my current <code>custom.css</code> file? It unloaded on me about how inefficient my CSS was and how and why to use variables. I asked a ton more questions, let it give me an example, and then got to work. My CSS is a lean, mean machine now, with a Table of Contents and proper variables, so I can make global changes without searching all over the place.</p>
<p><em>I WILL UPDATE AS I LEARN MORE</em></p>

<p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780007425389">The Hobbit (Enhanced Edition)</a> by J. R. R. Tolkien 📚</p>
<p>What is there to say about this book that hasn&rsquo;t already been said? First published September 21st, 1937. It&rsquo;s a classic, and I enjoy re-reading it from time to time. The 75th Anniversary Edition is really well done with lots of backstory and history. They have included original artwork by Tolkien and some pages from the original manuscript. Some of the letters between Tolkien and his publisher are interesting to read; the business side of books always gets in the way of a good story.</p>
<p>The quote that stood out to me this time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.&rdquo;
~ Thorin Oakenshield</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>I’ve always wanted one, but I knew I didn&rsquo;t need one. Money/Time spent on something that you really don&rsquo;t need. <a href="https://tailscale.com">TailScale</a> and how much I travel were the reasons I finally justified the purchase and took the time to set it up. </p>
<p>I purchased a low-end <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/">Mac mini</a>, an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FUERAN-Emulator-Headless-Supports-3840x2160/dp/B0D4Z7MR9G/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1QTMKRKBX8BT6&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.o4G4qnXqZSXDDAR5HiAHss2Sj43F9R-mO9XXajVXQA0Ktf4bJfpsgPa2M9H6c63dnXucPF4FDahw-YC5X_DQQwR-tnAYu2xp6g4dBVSZRnXAzD3lwudIfmgfA2XkvYF3QbT4KBFo-0jqp5cqGEXEzosmWS8s5kZ1pRTlhylG6HNHdtyTPjcaCAHL6fgKkkcMT5F9tfdoKlr06pyabMbOSKNafUmPp-Ug_8SYnbZsCB8.6xBGcrk2vqFu1p1z10Tdusk6JfB_yxkZf8pCfzUGC_8&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=hdmi%2Bdummy%2Bplug%2B4k&amp;qid=1767021372&amp;sprefix=HDMI%2Bdummy%2B%2Caps%2C257&amp;sr=8-3&amp;th=1">HDMI dummy plug</a>, and an external HD for Time Machine. Hardwire the Mac mini into your router. To start the headless operation, you need to plug in a screen, keyboard, and mouse initially. If you don’t have a spare screen lying around, you can use an iPad and the <a href="https://orion.tube">Orion App</a> with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Capture-1080P60-Streaming-Recorder-Compatible/dp/B08Z3XDYQ7?crid=12990E8QDBTEL&amp;keywords=usb%2Bc%2Bcapture%2Bcard&amp;qid=1695254389&amp;sprefix=usb%2Bc%2Bcapture%2Bcar%2Caps%2C115&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=luxoptics-20&amp;th=1">USB-C Capture Card</a>. This is what I did, and it worked brilliantly. Set up sharing, enable screen sharing, and configure the power-saving options you want. I recommend turning off power saving and leaving it running all the time, as that&rsquo;s its purpose. Turn on auto-login for the account you will use to manage it. If the mini restarts, you want it to log in automatically and start Plex and TailScale. You&rsquo;re still protected, because you&rsquo;ll set the screen saver to require the password immediately.</p>
<p>After that is set up, you can unplug your attachments and plug in the HDMI dummy plug so the mini thinks a screen is always attached. Head to your main computer, find the mini on your network, and screen share into it. You should never need to attach anything to it now. Keep things updated, and work on it using screen sharing from now on. </p>
<p>Numerous blogs, YouTube videos, and LLMs offer guidance on home server settings, so I won&rsquo;t go into more detail.</p>
<p>I deleted the apps I didn&rsquo;t want on the mini, logged into my Apple account, turned off cloud sync for desktop items, and installed Plex Server and TailScale. Plugged in a 4TB external HD for Time Machine and set that up. </p>
<p>I opened Plex, pointed it to my home NAS, and ensured it started automatically at login. TailScale setup can be a bit involved, and here is where I reached out to ChatGPT for some guidance: I wanted an Exit Node and Subnet for my home LAN. There is some command-line work here that was beyond my skill level. </p>
<p>Now, when I&rsquo;m traveling, which is every week, whether I have my iPad, Mac, or iPhone, I activate TailScale, turn on the Exit Node for my mini. It&rsquo;s just like I&rsquo;m sitting at home. I&rsquo;m protected as well, or better, than any commercial VPN, and I have access to any computer, NAS, router, or external HD on my home wifi network. </p>
<p>I can open Plex and watch live TV or media on my NAS. I was nothing short of frustrated with Plex Server running on my NAS. I had nothing but problems, and eventually just deleted it. But so far, Plex running on my mini has been rock-stable. I still prefer using Infuse for the front end to Plex. It just works. </p>
<p>The one area I have been unable to make work is printing to my home printers from the road. In theory, you can do this. I can make the printer print pages, but they&rsquo;re blank. There is a communication error in the printer setup somehow. I found my printers on the home network, renamed them, and attached them in a Finder window. Tried to print, but it doesn’t work. I went into Printer settings on my home computer and added the printers by their IP addresses, trying every available communication protocol, but that didn&rsquo;t work either.  I can open a Note and print it, but it prints blank. I&rsquo;ve tried every different setting, consulted ChatGPT, and no dice. I don&rsquo;t see a reason ever to print anything at home from the road, but I wanted to know if I could make it work. </p>
<p>Another advantage of the mini server is an additional place to store user documents on your home network. If you&rsquo;re uncomfortable having a document you&rsquo;re working on in the cloud, save it to your mini with the security of Time Machine backing everything up. 
You could also set up a web server to run a website. The internet offers many options and ideas for your home server. </p>
<p>It was a fun process; I really enjoyed setting it up and tweaking things. My primary purpose and justification are the TailScale benefits; as much as I travel, having the ability to browse the internet safely and access my home LAN is peace of mind. So far on the road, I&rsquo;ve had zero issues with performance or speed, doing all my internet needs through my home wifi. </p>
<p>To put a finer point on this Exit Node/Subnet feature, when you log into TailScale on your iPad, iPhone, Mac, any device, and then activate your home mini server Exit Node that is also setup to be a Subnet, your device thinks it&rsquo;s on your home LAN, you can do a IP address lookup and you&rsquo;ll show back at home. You have full access to everything on your home wifi. (Except maybe your printers) When you surf the internet, you are using your home wifi. Any website that cares where you are physically (I know some financial institutions won&rsquo;t let you log in if you are out of the country) will think you are home. This can also come into play with some streaming services. 
The Exit Node gives you access to your home internet. The Subnet provides access to your home LAN. You can set up an Exit Node with or without a Subnet. </p>
<p>I&rsquo;m no expert, and my terminology could be wrong in places; for that, I apologize. You networking experts will cringe at reading this (actually, no networking experts are reading my blog, ha!) Set up a home server and play with it; you’ll gain some good things. </p>
<p>If you have any questions, please post them below, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to answer them. As always, thanks for stopping by.</p>

<p>I’ve never put much thought into email before. It wasn&rsquo;t a super big deal to me; I had no professional needs with it, just a regular online-life email. I had no custom email addresses; I just used what Google and Apple gave me.</p>
<p>Until you read a few stories about people being locked out of their email accounts and losing everything.</p>
<p>This brings email to the forefront and makes you consider who your email provider is and whether you have a backup plan.</p>
<p>Most non-professionals end up with Apple Mail, Google Mail, Yahoo Mail, or a similar service. Remember AOL &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve Got Mail&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve had them all over the years, including Hotmail. The last few years have been focused on Apple, Gmail, and Yahoo. You know the routine: an Apple address for business, a Gmail address for website accounts, and Yahoo for my spammy stuff - <em>I don&rsquo;t care if I lose this email.</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always been enough.</p>
<p>Recently, a lot of fuss was made on Mastodon about an individual who lost his Apple account after being locked out for using a bogus Apple gift card, according to the story.</p>
<p>This made me deep-dive into my reliance on big companies and who controls my data, especially email, email addresses, email Providers, backup plans, and best practices to avoid losing access to your email.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying this is the best way, but it&rsquo;s a lot better than what I had. It may help you as well. I think it&rsquo;s pretty bulletproof.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-want">What you want:</h2>
<p><strong>Your own email addresses with a custom domain:</strong> They are yours; you never have to change them. You can move them to any domain provider that suits you. Mine are at <a href="https://www.hover.com">Hover</a>. If Hover ever goes out of business, or things get flaky, I can move my domain names to another provider. The important part is that my email addresses will never have to change unless I want them to.</p>
<p><strong>An email provider/service that you register your custom domain names to:</strong> This needs to be a service that has everything you need from a provider: cost, aliases, good apps, and a good look and feel. You can use your custom domains with Google or Apple, but why? You are risking some real hassles. There are excellent providers with minimal risk, such as <a href="https://www.fastmail.com">FastMail</a>, <a href="https://proton.me">Proton</a>, and others. This is where some good research will pay off. Review everything, find something that fits your needs and budget, then follow the Provider&rsquo;s instructions to register your domain names with it.
Remember, you can always move Providers later if you need to. At Proton, and now want to move to FastMail, just move your domains over to FastMail. In theory, you won&rsquo;t lose any emails, as undeliverable emails will bounce for days, always trying to reach their destination. By the time your domains are registered with the new Provider, emails sent to and from you during this transition period will eventually reach their new home. At least that is what I’m told.</p>
<p>I went with Proton Mail. They have easy-to-follow instructions for setting up your domains, provide email aliases, offer good apps, and encrypt your email from start to finish.</p>
<p><strong>An Alias Email Address Structure/System:</strong> The next step is to plan which email address to use for each location. You&rsquo;ll have your primary email address, your favorite one. You want to keep this one mostly off the internet. You don&rsquo;t want a ton of spam going to it after all these companies get hacked, and they have your email you used to sign up for all these services and accounts.
In steps aliases. Most email services provide aliases for you to use. I went with a custom domain for my aliases, too; this way, I have complete control over how they look and can maintain a regimented structure. I&rsquo;m using a service called <a href="https://simplelogin.io">SimpleLogin</a>. I attached my custom domain to it, and now, I can make a unique address for each online account I ever sign up for. This way, when it&rsquo;s eventually leaked online, and I start getting spam to it, I can change it. I only have to change one email address, and the spam stops. Suppose you use your primary email address for all your online accounts; you&rsquo;re stuck. You will eventually get tons of spam, and the thought of going back and changing hundreds of email addresses will make your eyes cross, and you&rsquo;ll say screw it.</p>
<h2 id="my-email-plan-in-action">My Email Plan in Action</h2>
<p>I have three custom domains. One is for my personal email, one is for secondary/recovery emails in online accounts, and the third is my aliases email with SimpleLogin.</p>
<p>My business and personal email are with my main/favorite email address. Every other online account has a unique email address, an alias. This is where your email Provider will help, or you can use a custom service like SimpleLogin. I’ve been using SimpleLogin for years now, and it’s an excellent service. I’ve had zero issues with them.  When that alias email gets compromised, and it will, I change that one email. Easy.</p>
<p>For example, I just signed up with The Atlantic magazine. It gets its own custom email: <a href="mailto:theatlantic@yourcustomdomain.com">theatlantic@yourcustomdomain.com</a>. I use the name of the account I&rsquo;m signing up for; that way, I always know which account it is and which email has been compromised. Hit the easy button!</p>
<p>I now have 150+ email addresses out there on the internet; they all go to the same email Provider and open in the same Mac or iOS app—clean, simple, and pretty bulletproof.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Everything can be moved.</li>
<li>Nobody can lock you out of your emails.</li>
<li>You’ll never have to change more than one email address when that one ends up on the dark web for sale, and hundreds of spam emails are inundating your inbox every day.</li>
<li>Every new account you sign up for gets its own email address. <a href="mailto:Your-new-account@yourcustomdomain.com">Your-new-account@yourcustomdomain.com</a> or a structure that you can remember. You’ll never forget your username again.</li>
<li>An easy backup schedule that can be automated if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Downsides</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You&rsquo;re not getting free email anymore. All this is going to cost you something every year. But, with that comes a lot of peace and a whole lot less spam.</li>
<li>Once you get your new email address, you will spend days, weeks, and maybe months changing all your emails from that Google address to your sporty new custom ones. But it&rsquo;s worth it. It will be the last time you have to do this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know if you have any additional tips or if you see a vulnerability in my plan.</p>

<p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9780593949245">1929</a> by Andrew Ross Sorkin 📚</p>
<p>Good book, well written. Focuses on the bankers and people who brought on the crash, the aftermath and the laws and institutions put into place to prevent another one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As technology made farming more efficient and less dependent on physical labor, huge numbers of farmworkers fell into economic distress, along with the towns they lived in, creating a widening gulf between the urban haves and the rural have-nots. Wall Street became like a giant balloon floating above the common people, its self-mythologizing leaders enjoying the comforts of what felt like a privileged realm. Government took little notice, as an extreme form of laissez-faire reigned in Washington.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very good book to read for any market investors, especially right now. There are many similarities.</p>

			 <h2 id="the-battle-of-analog-vs-digital">The Battle of Analog vs Digital</h2>
<p>Always on the edge. Always contemplating, planning, threatening to go analog.</p>
<p><em>Caution: unorganized thoughts below: <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></em></p>
<p>As a Gen X’er, I grew up in the analog era, and I retain both the right and the skill to return to it. I grew up without computers, cell phones, social media, or major newspapers. We had one local paper, some magazines, and plenty of books. In college, I got my first pager so I could find a pay phone, fish out some dimes and nickels, then beep a friend’s pager to call me back. We used all kinds of numeric codes for contact me, emergency, party tonight, what are you doing, etc.</p>
<p>For all the good technology brings, sometimes I’m not sure the good outweighs the bad. To a large degree, social media has a significant adverse effect on our mental health. With my current technology,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> which is pretty substantial (Synology, servers, cloud storage, Tailscale, VPNs, Subnets, Exit Nodes, Macs, iPads, iPhones, two blogs, etc), when it’s all working, it’s terrific; when it breaks down, it’s incredibly frustrating. I’ve certainly noticed a degradation in my attention span; I’ve been known to doom-scroll, and my wife has accused me of having ADHD—symptoms of our short attention digital world. One example is the shutdown of the <a href="https://www.creativelive.com/#?page=1">Creative Live</a> long-form educational website. They <a href="https://www.creativelive.com/company-update?via=header-banner_-1">cite</a> the lack of interest in long-form photography education.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>-<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Let’s envision our personal world without the internet. How would this work?</p>
<p>My parents are almost completely analog. My dad is entirely; he does not use anything digital at all. My mom uses light email and surfing with an iPad. No computer. Very little use of the internet for business needs. My grandmother has no internet and uses no digital devices. It can still be done in the modern world.</p>
<p>How much digital could you remove from your life? Let’s focus on your personal life; you’re stuck with what you have at work.</p>
<p><strong>Ebooks:</strong> I like them, I travel a lot, and I can carry hundreds of books with me at all times. I highlight, take notes, and everything syncs via Readwise, then into Obsidian. Could I drop all that and go back to paper books? Yes. I miss the feel and smell of paper. I could still highlight, write notes, etc. For a while, I would write out notes and highlights from the book I was reading on 3x5 cards, then either leave them in the book or file them for later use. I enjoy going back and reading my highlights and notes from old books. I do this every morning using Readwise, but I do have that backup analog plan.</p>
<p><strong>Journaling/Writing:</strong> I use DayOne and Drafts right now. Could I go back to pen and paper, maybe a typewriter? Yes. Would it slow down your writing, absolutely, and perhaps that’s a good thing. I still journal weekly in a paper notebook. I love the feel of a pen on paper. I print out pictures and put stickers on the pages. I very much enjoy analog journaling and want to keep it alive.</p>
<p><strong>All things financial:</strong> Banking, paying bills, etc. This would be very hard. Can you use the telephone to pay bills and stop into actual offices to drop off a check? Yes, you can. Depending on the size of the town you’re in, this could be easy or very hard. My grandmother and parents still drop off checks and pay credit card and cell phone bills via the phone. Would I want to do this? No. Not at all, but it could be done if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Photography:</strong> This is a big part of my life, a daily hobby. I love my digital camera and Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, and ON1 software. Could I go back to film? Maybe even a small dark room to develop your own pictures? Again, part of me says this would bring back a lot of joy and simplicity. In high school, I shot on film and developed my own pictures in the photo lab. I loved it. I loved the craft of film photography and the darkroom, watching those pictures slowly appear, floating in the solution. Could be done.</p>
<p><strong>To-do lists:</strong> I use Things and Reminders. They work great. Could I go back to a little notebook I carry in my pocket? Yes. Yes, I could. I have many Field Notes Notebooks that would be great for this.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Surfing/News/Blogs:</strong> This would be the most challenging part. Losing connections to people that you follow on their personal blogs and Mastodon. When I left FB, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc, it was hard to lose some connections, but over time it&rsquo;s been just fine. I can do it. But maybe this would also strengthen your connections with your community, your neighbors. I haven’t been to a local hobby group in many years. Not having the online world would change that for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Business Needs:</strong> This would be impossible in some areas. Applying for jobs, grants, business forms, Federal and State applications, you may not have a analog choice here. It would be off to the library to use a computer. I think more and more is headed in this direction.</p>
<p>In summary, we may be moving toward a world in which it will be almost impossible to live without internet technology. But we can always limit it, watch out for the harm it causes in our lives, and adapt. Gen X&rsquo;ers have seen a life without the internet; it was a good life. Is my life richer with the internet? Yes, in so many ways it is. I have so many more connections/friends and get exposed to so many more ideas/beliefs/thoughts that make me a better human being. That&rsquo;s my lens I view all of this through, if it&rsquo;s not making me a better, smarter, kinder, calmer, more compassionate human, then it needs to go. I think the good outweighs the bad if you control it and watch for the areas that affect you negatively. Long Live a <em>Good</em> Internet.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve read any of my blog posts, you know that I&rsquo;m a terrible writer and my writing structure is a hot mess. I need a good, cheap editor! Ya, I consistently received C&rsquo;s and D&rsquo;s in English classes all the way through college. No one will ever pay me to write. But, hopefully, it&rsquo;s enough to make you think about things; that&rsquo;s the purpose of reading something: to challenge, to inspire, to make you think.

<p>I do see the irony here. I&rsquo;m maybe deeper into technology than the average person, but I always want a plan for an organized exit from it all. I&rsquo;ve reduced my social media to a minimum and moved almost all of it to places I control. I love playing with and experimenting with new tech, using complex software that I really don&rsquo;t need. But boy, do I have days when I want to drop all of it and just go build a cedar-strip canoe in the garage. Maybe a better way to say it is, I have a tech hobby, nothing in my life <em>really</em> depends on it, I could drop it all, and my life would be just fine, certainly better in some areas. Technology frustrates me to no end some days, but you know, all things have their day.

<p>I really enjoyed the peek behind the curtain on how the sausage is made. I would love to spend a month just observing the process of creating a monthly magazine.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the job of sorting through thousands of monthly cartoon submissions, picking out 30, and having your boss pick out of that list 3 to 5 for publication?</p>

<p>My travel/hiking/flight-bag camera has always been my Olympus OMD E-M1 Mark II. It&rsquo;s small, lightweight, and performs magically in handheld low-light situations. I would really like to do more bird photography, and the latest OM-1 offers a big step up in focus tracking and frame-per-second shooting. I went ahead and pulled the trigger on it and have been very happy with it so far. I know it&rsquo;s an old camera now and needs to be updated, but it&rsquo;s a big step up in performance for me.</p>
<p>Not sure if I&rsquo;m going to sell the OMD or keep it for bashing around in a backpack or something.</p>
<p><a href="https://reallyrightstuff.com/Olympus-OM-1-L-Plate-Set/">Really Right Stuff Modular L-Plate Set</a> I&rsquo;ve been using RRS L-Plates on my cameras for years, excellent quality stuff. Of course, my OMD plate doesn&rsquo;t fit, so I had to get the one for the OM-1.</p>
<p>Picked up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0G1M6C6TS?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&amp;th=1">Godox iT32 with X50 Flash Trigger</a>. I&rsquo;ve had a few practice sessions with it, and so far I&rsquo;m really impressed. The magnetic hotshoe lets you mount it on a camera or take it off and hand-hold it wherever the flash needs to be. I&rsquo;m going to get this for the Nikon as well.</p>
<h3 id="rolleiflex">Rolleiflex</h3>
<p>My focus screen is so dark that I&rsquo;ve essentially stopped using the camera because I struggle to see what I&rsquo;m shooting and focus properly.</p>
<p>In steps <a href="https://bright-screen.com">BrightScreen</a>. Where have you been all my life! I got a prompt reply from Rick about a few questions I had, and days later, I had my new screen with good instructions attached.</p>
<p>I replaced the screen in about 20 minutes, and most of that time was spent cleaning while the hood and focus screen were off. It&rsquo;s like a new camera! A very bright, clear, focus screen. I&rsquo;m in love again.</p>
<p>If you have a dim focus screen, please don&rsquo;t wait any longer and look at <a href="https://bright-screen.com">BrightScreens</a>. They have screens for over 50 different camera models.</p>

I don&rsquo;t know how many electronics I&rsquo;ve ruined by accidentally leaving the batteries in and having them leak their acid into the inner electronics.</p>

			 <p>Doing an office deep clean, came across this beauty. The first-generation Apple TV (the Apple and the TV were not attached back then) Model A1218, announced in January 2007 and released in March 2007.</p>
<p>I was so excited for this to come out, I ordered it the first day that I could.</p>
<p>Researching it online, I&rsquo;m told Steve Jobs demoed it in September 2006 and called it &ldquo;iTV&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking through my old Apple boxes to see if I kept the box. I&rsquo;m told it&rsquo;s highly sought after.</p>
<p>When I get time, I&rsquo;m going to plug it in and see if it still fires up.</p>

			 <p><em>It&rsquo;s blog update day!</em></p>
<p>Went to the dentist today for stage two of implant surgery, so it seemed like a good time, while I nursed my sore gums, to spend the afternoon updating, tweaking, and loving on my blog.</p>
<p>I take big breaks from working on the blog, but when I get the chance for a multi-hour work spree on it, I really enjoy it.</p>
<p>What Got Done:</p>
<ol>
<li>Updated the <a href="https://cliff538.com/essentials/">Essentials Page</a>.</li>
<li>Updated the  <a href="https://cliff538.com/now-page/">Now Page</a>.</li>
<li>Updated <a href="https://cliff538.com/2025/01/06/title-where-do-you-find.html">Book Resources</a>.</li>
<li>Added a <a href="https://cliff538.com/reading/">&ldquo;Started But Did Not Finish&rdquo; book shelf</a>.</li>
<li>Added another link to the 365 Photo Challenge Blog <a href="https://365pixels.xyz">365Pixels</a> in the main navigation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yet To Do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add more photo sets to the photography page.</li>
<li>Make a dedicated coffee page where I can talk about espresso machines, grinders, coffee beans, pour-over technique, scales, etc etc, just a whole lotta coffee love ☕️ page.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cliff Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I really struggled with removing my sidebar on my main page. I&rsquo;m just torn about it. Some days I like it, other days I dislike it. I did remove it from all other pages, so it&rsquo;s only on the main page now. Also, on small screens, you don&rsquo;t even see it due to a lack of real estate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let me leave you with this: if you&rsquo;ve ever thought about having your own blog and getting off all other social media, I can&rsquo;t recommend it enough. Own and control your stuff!</p>

<p>Set in the same world as The Girl With All The Gifts, but along a different timeline. Again, a good story that made me think about it while I wasn&rsquo;t reading it. The end has a great 20 years later Epilogue that ties back in with Melanie. I won&rsquo;t say anymore, but it&rsquo;s a great ending to a very good book.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed this book. If you like apocalyptic end-of-the-world stories, this is a good one. It&rsquo;s a simple book, but well written with good character building. It was a book I thought about when I wasn&rsquo;t reading it and made extra time to get back to it.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed this; it meshes very closely with the book &ldquo;Nuclear War&rdquo; by Annie Jacobsen, to the extent that I initially thought it was based on the book. It&rsquo;s not.</p>

<p>Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781538765494">Parable of the Sower</a> by Octavia E. Butler 📚</p>
<p>I’m a fan of post-apocalyptic stories and this one does not disappoint. Really enjoyed the story.</p>
<p>Lauren Olamina lives in an America ravaged by climate change, social collapse and extreme violence. When she loses her home and most of her family, she travels North with a small group of survivors looking for a new place to settle. Along the way she shares her new belief system, &ldquo;Earthseed&rdquo; which teaches that God is not something or someone but change itself. God is Change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All that you touch
You Change.
All that you Change
Changes you.
The only lasting truth
Is Change.
God
Is Change.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An interesting twist is that Lauren has Hyperempathy. At times very much a curse living in such a violent world. I&rsquo;ll let you read the book to find out more about Hyperempathy.</p>
<p>I may take a break and read something else then jump back to part two of the series, Parable of the Talents.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m a daily user of the meditation app Waking Up. I&rsquo;m not a Buddhist, but I love many of their teachings. Along with daily meditation, this makes me a better person and gives me freedom from ruminating on my thoughts.</p>
<p>I listen to many talks from Joseph Goldstein and usually take the time to make notes. I started a new series within the App called The Eightfold Path, which is hosted by Dan Harris, Joseph Goldstein, and Sam Harris. The first talk was approximately two hours long, and I listened to it once through uninterrupted, then returned a second time with the purpose of taking notes.</p>
<p>I thought I&rsquo;d post my notes from the first talk. Perhaps this will pique your interest enough to want to listen to the entire series, or maybe even try meditation. It has changed my life.</p>
<h1 id="the-eightfold-path">&ldquo;The Eightfold Path&rdquo;</h1>
<p>Dan Harris, Joseph Goldstein, &amp; Sam Harris on the Waking Up App.</p>
<h2 id="day-1----the-right-view">Day 1 -  The Right View</h2>
<p>Someone asked the Buddha, Are there still enlightened beings in the world? As long as people are practicing the Eightfold path, there will be enlightened beings in the world.</p>
<p>Enlightened, awakened: The uprooting of greed, hatred, and delusion.</p>
<p>Assess your practice, are you suffering less or more?</p>
<p>Generosity, Love, and Wisdom are causes of greater happiness.</p>
<h3 id="dukkha">Dukkha:</h3>
<p>The Pali word is usually translated as suffering, but Joseph likes the inevitability of unwanted experiences. And why the inevitability? because everything is unstable, everything is continually changing. Things are becoming otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="the-monkey-trap">The monkey trap:</h3>
<p>Hunters will hollow out a coconut and make a small hole, just big enough for a monkey to put his empty hand through. Inside is a sweet, tempting treat. The monkey slides his hand through and grabs the treat, but is unable to remove his hand while holding the treat. The hunter is approaching, and the monkey is trapped. Unable to remove his hand. It is the rare monkey that can &ldquo;let go&rdquo; and remove its hand. Because of the force, the habit, the deeply conditioned habit of grasping to what is pleasant, holding on.</p>
<h3 id="you-get-to-the-edge-of-your-comfortdiscomfort">You get to the edge of your comfort/discomfort:</h3>
<p>Level of discomfort, painful emotion, you get to the edge, the goal of practice is not to avoid that, it&rsquo;s a benefit that the practice leads you to this place. You can learn how to relax into whatever that experience might be without holding onto it or pushing it away.
You are seeing the impermanence of the discomfort, the emotion, so your comfort zone gets a little bigger.
With more practice, over the years, you are enlarging your comfort zone, ultimately to the place where you have no edges. So, whatever arises, the mind is relating to it from a place of greater freedom.</p>
<p>Earth, Air, Fire, Water.
Plasma, Gas, Liquid, Solid.</p>
<h3 id="the-two-arrows">The Two Arrows:</h3>
<p>The first arrow is the pain. The second arrow is all the mental suffering you might add to the physical pain. The Buddha points out that it&rsquo;s the second arrow that we can work with. How we relate to it is up to us.</p>
<h3 id="letting-go">Letting Go:</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the best phrase, but using the phrase &ldquo;Letting Be&rdquo; is much better. If something is painful, you&rsquo;re not holding onto it; you don&rsquo;t want it. Letting Be is a better description. Let it be, watch it change, watch it go away.</p>
<h3 id="preferences">Preferences:</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s not, not having preferences. It&rsquo;s not being attached to the preference.
You&rsquo;ve been planning the buffet all day long, craving sweet buns, and you get to the buffet and they are out of sweet buns. Ideally, this would not cause a ripple in thought, nor cause suffering.
To hold what is pleasant and unpleasant with equanimity.</p>
<h3 id="buddha-would-visit-the-sick">Buddha would visit the sick:</h3>
<p>I hope your pain is diminishing, but the patient would say No, it&rsquo;s getting worse. The Buddha would say, Though your body is afflicted, may your mind remain unafflicted.</p>
<h3 id="mental-suffering">Mental Suffering:</h3>
<p>Our thoughts on the past, present, and future bring the most suffering.
The real promise of meditation is that, though the first arrow of physical pain is inevitable, the second arrow of mental suffering in all its forms, certainly your suffering of thoughts of the past, present, and future, is something that you can wake up from.</p>
<p>The Buddha said mental suffering is worse than physical suffering. The teachings of the Buddha are how to free ourselves from that mental suffering.</p>
<h3 id="first-step-of-the-eightfold-path-is-right-view">First Step of the Eightfold Path is Right View:</h3>
<p>One expression of wrong view is: it&rsquo;s the feeling or experience of, I&rsquo;m happy, or I&rsquo;m sad, I&rsquo;m afraid, I&rsquo;m bored, etc. This is the common way we interpret our experience. The wrong view aspect is the claiming of that mind state to be the self, to be I. Which is so deeply embedded into our conditioning.
So the relief from that suffering is to be mindful enough, aware enough, of the emotions themselves as being impersonal.</p>
<p>One Tibetan teaching says, <em>Thoughts and emotions wander through the mind like clouds in the sky, no roots, no home.</em>
What we can do is to root those emotions in the view of self, and that is what is problematic.
Our practice of meditation is to see the emotions, the thoughts, for what they are: moving, always changing, passing by. Do not root them into the ground, into your mind as yours, as I.</p>
<p>Right View sets the direction of your path.</p>
<p>The first level of Right View is sometimes called Mundane Right View. It has to do with the right view for developing greater ease and happiness in our lives. How do we live wisely in a way that reduces suffering, creates more ease, aligns us, and puts us in harmony with the way things are?</p>
<p>The understanding that our actions have consequences. The Law of Karma. All of our actions will bear fruit at some point, depending on the motivation associated with the action.</p>
<p>When we act motivated by greed or anger, motivated by delusion, that is like planting the Karmic seed of some future unwanted experience. On the other hand, when we act motivated by generosity or love, by understanding or wisdom, that is planting the seed of some future desirable experiences.</p>
<p>When we act, it&rsquo;s usually without thinking about where this act is coming from, what the Karmic consequences would be. Without taking the time to consider our motivations. Where is this act coming from, where is it leading, and do I want to go where it&rsquo;s leading?</p>
<p>Which feels better, being happy and kind and loving, or being angry and upset? Which person do other people want to be around? It&rsquo;s so simple and so powerful.</p>
<p>In the texts, it emphasizes the value of generosity, a behavior to cultivate, not just because it feels good in the moment but because it has very good Karmic consequences.</p>
<p>Make generosity a practice.</p>
<p>On the spiritual path, time is not a factor. We, especially in the West, want results now; we don&rsquo;t want to wait. The spiritual path takes time, and time is not a factor if we are on the right path, going in the right direction.</p>
<h3 id="deep-dive-into-talking-about-belief-in-the-deeper-parts-of-buddhism-like-rebirth-and-karma">Deep Dive into talking about belief in the deeper parts of Buddhism, like rebirth and Karma:</h3>
<p>The willing suspension of disbelief. We can be attached to our disbeliefs as strongly as our beliefs.</p>
<p>Saying &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; is very different than saying &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Be open to the possibility.</p>
<p>Sam references Pascal&rsquo;s Wager in relation to belief in rebirth.</p>
<h4 id="pascals-wager">Pascal&rsquo;s Wager:</h4>
<p>Pascal argued that when it comes to belief in God, we face a kind of <strong>wager</strong> or bet:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If God exists</strong> and you believe → you gain infinite reward (eternal life).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If God exists</strong> and you don’t believe → you risk infinite loss (eternal punishment or loss of salvation).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If God does not exist</strong> and you believe → you lose little or nothing (maybe some worldly pleasures).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If God does not exist</strong> and you don’t believe → you gain little or nothing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, from a <strong>practical, risk–reward perspective</strong>, believing in God is the “better bet,” because the potential gains outweigh the potential losses.</p>
<p>Joseph had a teacher who said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to believe it to become enlightened; it&rsquo;s true, but you don&rsquo;t have to believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 id="dans-summary-of-mundane-right-view">Dan&rsquo;s summary of Mundane Right View:</h4>
<pre><code>Understanding that actions have results or consequences. 
Understanding that awakening is possible.
The root of suffering is craving. 
Joseph adds, selflessness or non-self. 
</code></pre>
<p>We don&rsquo;t invite our thoughts to come; you can, but most of your thoughts come uninvited.</p>
<p>One technique is to treat your thoughts that pop into your head as if they are coming from the person next to you. It can help you not identify with them.</p>
<p>As the thought is there, ask the question, What is a thought? Not what the thought is saying. But what the thought is as a phenomenon. You&rsquo;ll find that it&rsquo;s not much.
You are taking the power away from the thought. You can get angry, or jealous, or have a very strong emotion over a little, small thought. Take that power away. Look at what that thought is. The empty nature of thought.</p>

<p>Unexamined thoughts are everything, and examined thoughts are nothing.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Love the life you have, with the stuff you have, and try to improve it a little bit each day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take pictures of everything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tell your friends and family that you love them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Talk to random strangers, connect with people, even just for a few minutes. You may brighten their day, and yours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do something you are scared to do. Start small and work up to &ldquo;No Fucking Way, I&rsquo;m doing that&rdquo; kind of stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Declutter both physically and mentally. Give something away. Clean up that pile of papers on your desk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read a book with your phone on silent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to buy something, put it in your cart and wait a day or two. Then, ask yourself, Will this still be useful in three months? Will this bring happiness? Is this thing worth going to work for?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can skip the pursuit of happiness altogether and just be happy.</p>

<p>This really saddens me. I know personally (and I&rsquo;m in the minority here), I would much rather read a great book than play video games. And, it&rsquo;s not from trying, I have a PS5, Gameboys, and Switches, and I just don&rsquo;t play them very much at all. When I&rsquo;m reading a good book, I think about it when I&rsquo;m not reading and look forward to getting back to it.</p>
<p>To each their own, but I fear that we are not promoting reading and showing children the joys of it. My wife was a grade school librarian for 12+ years and read to students every day, opening up whole new worlds for them. Sadly, librarians seem to be a thing of the past. It is our loss.</p>

<p>“There are strange things done in the midnight sun
By the men who moil for gold;
The Arctic trails have their secret tales
That would make your blood run cold;
The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,
But the queerest they ever did see
Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge ?

			 <p>I love photography—everything about it: carrying a camera around, freezing moments of time, downloading the photos to my computer to see what I’ve got, processing them, tweaking them, and making them just right. I share them because I’m happy with the picture, and maybe it inspires someone else. Pictures start conversations. Pictures can make you cry, think, or even change your mind. </p>
<p>I want to say a few words about the inspiration part. </p>
<p>At first, looking at other people&rsquo;s photography was inspiring. But over time, it started to have the opposite effect. I wasn&rsquo;t learning&ndash;I was comparing. And comparison is a trap.</p>
<p>You can take in so much of other people’s photography that it can make you feel bad about yours. It can make you put your camera down with a sigh; why even bother? I suck; there are 10,000 better photographers out there sharing amazing content, and nobody needs to see my crap pictures&hellip;. and on and on and on—the dark side. </p>
<p>A lot of this is from social media itself. </p>
<p>Some from looking at/consuming more photography than you are out shooting. More Consuming, Less Making.</p>
<p>I struggled with this a few years ago and completely put my camera down and stopped taking pictures. I felt like, why bother, my stuff is crap. I spent too much time looking at other people&rsquo;s photography, taking classes, and worrying about my gear instead of just being outside taking pictures, loving my hobby, and working on my craft. </p>
<p>Be inspired, look at other people&rsquo;s work, but know when to stop. Know when to get outside and shoot. Work on your stuff, find your happy place, and find your niche in this big photography world. There are limitless photos uploaded every day. <em>In 2024, it&rsquo;s estimated that 14 BILLION photos were uploaded to social media EVERY DAY</em>. You can&rsquo;t compete with that; you can&rsquo;t even look at 1% of those photos in your lifetime. </p>
<p>Find your group, find your niche, or don&rsquo;t. Just take pictures if it brings you joy. Upload them to your socials, or don&rsquo;t. Make a website, or don’t. Do what is right for you. There is no good and bad. There is only art. Your art. Do what brings some joy to your heart. Make yourself smile. And if you do upload your photos, I can guarantee that somebody sees them, and it makes them smile, makes them think, brings them a little joy, and most of all, inspires them to go out and take some pictures. </p>
<h3 id="epilogue">Epilogue: </h3>
<p>Photography has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. I fell in love with it back in high school; we were lucky enough to have a yearly photography class with a complete darkroom. I took it almost every year through school; we rolled our own film and developed our film. My dad gave me his old Pentax camera, and I shot a lot of pictures. </p>
<p>At one point, photography became more than just a passion&ndash;it became a business. I sold my aviation prints online, and for a while, it felt like I was living the dream. But soon, I found myself spending more time answering emails, processing orders, and futzing with gear than actually out taking photos.  </p>
<p>Selling my photos online and making a business out of it brought me down a dark hole where I would look at “better” photographers and their work, and I kept feeling worse and worse about my skills and how I couldn’t push it to the next level. Their pictures were always better. </p>
<p>I stopped taking pictures. </p>
<p>Completely. </p>
<p>For years, not a single photograph. </p>
<p>Cameras put away in a drawer, deleted all my photo apps from my computer. I was done. </p>
<p>Not long ago, on Mastodon, I started seeing people’s photography, passion, and love for the art. And boy, did it spark that love again for me. No more selling, no more comparing, just doing what I love to do, even if it sucks. </p>
<p>I want to express my deepest gratitude to the photographers I follow on Mastodon. Your work, your passion, and your love for the art have reignited my own love for photography. You’ve inspired me and brought me back to what I truly love. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. </p>
<p>Somebody out there will see your work, and it will spark something in them&ndash;just like the photographers I follow on Mastodon did for me. And maybe, one day, they&rsquo;ll be the ones inspiring someone else to pick up a camera again.</p>
<p>Cameras up. Let’s go shooting. </p>

			<h1><a href="https://cliff538.com/2025/02/18/bringing-just-a-little-joy.html">Bringing a Little Joy Into My Day and Weekly Planning</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://cliff538.com/2025/02/18/bringing-just-a-little-joy.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-02-18 15:22:31 -0700">Feb 18, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>There are endless blog posts about the latest to-do apps and systems. My goal is not to proclaim from the rooftops that I&rsquo;ve found the secret to daily planning success but to share some thoughts on a few options that I have found very rewarding.</p>
<p>I have a <em>constant</em> struggle with Analog vs Digital; it perturbs me how much I think about this. I&rsquo;ve given up worrying about which type of system it is, and I do what feels right and what keeps me on track. And, if that system brings a little joy to the process, even better.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been a <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> app user for years now and love it. It&rsquo;s quick and easy on all my devices and syncs well. It&rsquo;s always on my desktop at home as a gentle reminder to keep me on track for the day. My problem with it is planning my week or my day. Things is an ever-growing constant list that mostly sits stagnant, and I have little interaction with it on a daily basis. I&rsquo;ve tried building my day in calendar apps, and that works, but they don&rsquo;t stay open. I close them at some point, and the day aimlessly drifts off down rabbit holes. One requirement I&rsquo;ve found is that the day planner must <em>always</em> be visible.</p>
<p>When planning my week and day, I was missing something and wasn&rsquo;t staying on track throughout the day. It&rsquo;s all there in Things, but I don&rsquo;t have any draw to it; I can&rsquo;t touch it or grab it and alter it. I&rsquo;m primarily digital, but I need/crave some pen and paper touch—not too much, though; I&rsquo;ve tried paper journaling, and that&rsquo;s too much. I love journaling in <a href="https://dayoneapp.com">DayOne</a>.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://ugmonk.com">Ugmonk</a>. First, this is not a cheap system upfront, but by the time you read this, they will have a much more affordable metal version for sale (launching February 19th, 2025), which has been much needed. Also, this system is not complex; you could easily make your own with some woodworking skills or a 3D printer and 3x5 cards. The cost for me is worth it; it brings me a little joy, it looks great sitting on the desk, and I&rsquo;ve stayed on track better throughout the day.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the system for over a month and love it. I&rsquo;m still not sold on using the weekly and daily views together, but for now, it&rsquo;s both. It comes down to how your brain works and what you need to see. I&rsquo;m a person with an odd job. I&rsquo;m away from home for 3 to 4 days a week. So, when I&rsquo;m home, I need to see what is left of my week and what I want to accomplish that day. I never know what day of the week or day of the month it is; it just doesn&rsquo;t matter to me. I have large calendar widgets on all my devices to help me remember. All I want to know, what I need to know, is how many days off I have until I go back to work and what I want to get done on those days.</p>
<p>I use the weekly card for this. On my first day off, I grab a fresh card and my favorite pen and map out my week in broad strokes; it sits on my desk, so I&rsquo;m constantly reminded. Then, each day, I formulate a plan with the daily card.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There is something special about grabbing that thick, beautiful paper and writing on it with your favorite pen. It gives substance to the plan; it sinks it just a little bit deeper into memory by writing it out. It makes me smile; it brings just a little joy, and I like that. Plus, I always have paper to quickly grab to make quick notes using the backside of the weekly or daily card. When done with the day or the week, I can store them away, or I&rsquo;ve been using them for bookmarks.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As an option to this analog version, I just learned about <a href="https://tweek.so">Tweek</a>. I&rsquo;ve used this alongside my Ugmonk/Things system just for testing. I think Tweek is really cool; I wish I had come up with it. If I ever want to drop Ugmonk, I&rsquo;d go with Tweek. They have full function under their free plan, so you can test it to see if it fits into your world. But it&rsquo;s sterile for me; I need some analog, I need to touch some nice paper, and I need to use my favorite pen. I need that little piece of joy to start my day, the constant visual reminder, and that satisfaction of marking off an item with my Sharpie.</p>
<p>I hope some of this helps you with your task list. Thank you, as always, for visiting my little piece of the web. Cheers!</p>

			 <p>Ever seen the inside a Saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea)?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The woody skeleton inside the saguaro gives a framework of interconnected, woody ribs that provide structural support, enabling the cactus to reach heights of up to 40–50 feet.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Unfortunately, this saguaro is going to look like this fairly soon.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Saguaros have evolved to withstand the harsh conditions of the desert. However, the increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves in the Phoenix area have begun to exceed their tolerance levels. This is a very sad example of climate change here in the Phoenix Valley.</p>
<p>If anything good can be said of it, it will at least feed the desert critters; they seem to love munching on the soft green flesh.</p>
<p>Here, you can see where they are nibbling at the base of this young saguaro.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The green flesh has all been consumed here just leaving the reddish brown woody underside.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This green lichen is all over the rocks; it is this bright fluorescent green, and I haven&rsquo;t bumped the color at all.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Desert rocks here have what is called Desert Varnish. It is a dark, glossy coating that forms on the surface of rocks in arid environments over thousands of years. You can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_varnish?utm_source=chatgpt.com">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can really see the shiny thick varnish on this rock. It can make for some beautiful colors.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here you can see their shallow root system.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Saguaros possess an extensive but shallow root system, spreading out as wide as the cactus is tall, to efficiently capture rainfall.  This also makes them more prone to falling over and, unfortunately, being stolen from the wild.</p>
<p>I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed this little desert walk.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://cliff538.com/2025/02/15/whats-unique-about-the-number.html">The Challenge of Reading in the Digital Age</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://cliff538.com/2025/02/15/whats-unique-about-the-number.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2025-02-15 17:09:46 -0700">Feb 15, 2025</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <h3 id="whats-unique-about-the-number-of-books-read">What’s unique about the number of books read?</h3>
<p>Why do we track how many books we read? Why not count articles, magazines, or blog posts? Imagine an app that monitors every word you read and provides a total at the end of the year. Perhaps the next wave of AI-powered glasses will track not only how much we read but what we retain.</p>
<p>But does the number really matter? If you quizzed me on all 30 books I read last year, how much could I recall? Would I even want to know my exact retention rate? Maybe I should focus less on quantity and more on comprehension. Could tools like Readwise, which helps revisit past highlights, improve retention?</p>
<p>One approach I&rsquo;ve been refining is writing about each book after finishing it. I review my highlights, jot down my thoughts, and create a mini book report. Readwise syncs with Obsidian, pulling in my highlights so I can reflect on key insights. I structure my notes with sections like <strong>Key Points, Personal Impact, and Action Items</strong>, and I&rsquo;m considering adding details on who might benefit from reading the book, whether I&rsquo;ve shared it with others, and if I&rsquo;ve blogged about it.</p>
<h3 id="the-power-of-books">The Power of Books</h3>
<p>Books offer something unique&ndash;deep knowledge, immersion into another world, and a window into someone else&rsquo;s perspective. Yet, attention spans seem to be shrinking. The internet has rewired how we consume information, making it harder to sit down and focus on a book. Some people struggle to finish long-form articles, let alone entire books. Does that matter? Are short-form videos and bite-sized text replacing deep study? The answer seems obvious.</p>
<p>Reading is a skill that requires practice. We should guard against losing it. Slow down. Put your phone on <strong>Do Not Disturb</strong>. Get lost in a good story. Let a book transport you beyond the present moment.</p>
<p>I struggle with this too. Even after reading over 30 books last year, I sometimes find my mind wandering after just a few sentences. I&rsquo;ll read a page, then realize I absorbed none of it. Even rereading it doesn&rsquo;t always help. When that happens, I close my eyes and focus on my breath&ndash;just breathe, slow down, reset. Losing the ability to focus is unsettling, not just for individuals but for society, workplaces, and families.</p>
<h3 id="a-modern-problem">A Modern Problem?</h3>
<p>Is this inability to focus solely a product of the internet age? I&rsquo;m not sure. I didn&rsquo;t use computers until high school or have internet access until college, yet I remember struggling to concentrate even then. Maybe distraction isn&rsquo;t new&ndash;maybe it&rsquo;s just easier than ever to indulge in.</p>
<p>The real challenge is <strong>how</strong> we engage with information. Do we skim and forget, or do we slow down and absorb? Reading isn&rsquo;t just about finishing books&ndash;it&rsquo;s about understanding, applying, and growing. That&rsquo;s what I want to improve.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve seen this posted about Mastodon a lot, and then @amerpie posted about it yesterday, and I thought, why the heck not? Let&rsquo;s check it out; I&rsquo;ve got some time to kill.</p>
<p>So, yeah, this <a href="https://kiwix.org/en/">KIWIX</a> is really cool. I&rsquo;m not a Super Bowl kind of guy, so I downloaded Kiwix and then proceeded to download the entire Wikipedia, then iFixit, then Gutenberg. Sheesh, why not? I have a Synology with ample space, so why not lock some of this stuff in and have it on local storage?</p>
<p>If you read some of the reviews on Kiwix, you&rsquo;d think it doesn&rsquo;t work well, but I&rsquo;ve had zero issues with it; I&rsquo;m using the Mac App. So now I&rsquo;m a downloading fool, gathering what I can for no apparent reason other than because I can&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here is their <a href="https://library.kiwix.org/#lang=eng&amp;category=">Library</a> of downloads. Check it out and see if there is anything you may want to have stored locally.</p>
<p>Some of the files are huge, so good storage capacity is a must, but they have tons of different download options if you are interested in just sections of, say, Wikipedia.</p>
<p>You can even run a local Wi-Fi network from a Raspberry Pi with all your downloaded data. This would be great for classrooms, but I may do this just for the fun of it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to have it stored locally, but clearly, the mission is for folks who have limited or no internet access. It&rsquo;s free to use and looks like a worthy endeavor to <a href="https://kiwix.org/en/get-involved/#donate">support</a> with your skills or finances.</p>
<p>Here is their <a href="https://kiwix.org/en/about-us/#our-story">About Page</a>. Some pretty cool stuff here, like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Short Story
Did you know that you could store the entirety of Wikipedia on your phone? And read it anywhere, at anytime?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Long Story
We can make highly compressed copies of entire websites that each fit into a single (.zim) file. Zim files are small enough that they can be stored on users’ mobile phones, computers or small, inexpensive Hotspot.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kiwix then acts like a regular browser, except that it reads these local copies. People with no or limited internet access can enjoy the same browsing experience as anyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The software as well as the content are fully open-source and free to use and share. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The Challenge <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
50% of the world&rsquo;s population has no reliable access to the internet. This can be because of cost, lack of infrastructure, or censorship. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The Solution – How Does It Work? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
We copy educational websites and compress them into files that people can take with them and browse anytime, anywhere.
Kiwix Is Also A Nonprofit
Most of our revenue comes from donations. We do not display ads, nor do we collect personal data.</p>

You don&rsquo;t waste time on people who drain your energy.</p>

Title: Unknown; I’m calling it Hippo Love. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Link: Unknown. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I have two desktop screens. One&rsquo;s background picture constantly changes; the other has this, which never changes. The love, care, and trust that this picture imparts makes me smile every day. I would love to know the background of this shot. I would love to talk to this man and find out about his relationship with this hippo. What is the hippo&rsquo;s name? How long was he a part of this hippo&rsquo;s life? Was this a daily ritual? How long did they sit there? Who took the picture?</p>
<p>I love the working-class feel of the picture. I had that lunch box for a while growing up. I love the tape on it. Mostly, I love the hippos' look of complete security and peace. No matter what was going on in this hippo&rsquo;s life, at this moment, all was well with the world.</p>
<p>When I look at this picture first thing in the morning when the computer whirls to life and the screens pop on, all is right in my world, too.</p>

<p>(⭐️3.75/5) - Finished reading: <a href="https://micro.blog/books/9781250285713">CABIN</a> by Patrick Hutchison. It&rsquo;s a good book, makes you laugh, and brought back many memories for me building forts in the woods as a kid. A writer with zero handyman skills buys a $7000 cabin in the woods of Washington State and tells the adventures of fixing it up along with the joys and life-changing memories of having an off-grid cabin that eventually changed his life and career.  📚</p>

			 <h3 id="does-watching-the-intro-to-every-episode-mean-something">Does watching the intro to every episode mean something?</h3>
<p>Netflix, AppleTV, Hulu, etc., allow you to skip intros. What does this say about the intro quality or the show? Or about us as humans who are always in a hurry. This behavior of skipping intros may reflect our impatience and desire to get to the main content quickly. As a designer of intros, do you get the data on how many people skip your intro? Does it make you want to change it? Why do some shows change each season&rsquo;s intro and others do not? Budget? How much does it cost to change the intro each season? Is this a metric that is used at all?</p>
<p>Such curious questions.</p>
<p>What we do: We always watch the whole intro of the first episode; it can be a source of insight into the show, somehow set the tone, or even give hints, and then we don&rsquo;t watch it again until the last episode. But there are exceptions. When the intro is fantastic, the show is an all-time favorite, or it seems an essential part of the show, or maybe it&rsquo;s because you don&rsquo;t want the show to end, and you want to watch every second of it. This has been the case for Chefs Table, Game of Thrones, Murders In The Building, Severance, Westworld, and others. </p>
<p>What about when the intro or trailer is better than the show itself? Maybe the folks making the intro need a raise because they condensed your mediocre show/movie into something good!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m talking just about intros, but the same could be said about the credits. How many times do you watch the credits? For me, it&rsquo;s rare, but when I do, it&rsquo;s because I want to know where it was filmed, the names of the people who made such an amazing piece of art, or the show was so powerful that you want to absorb every last drop.</p>

<p>Get ready for a new post, popping up weekly, monthly, or whenever inspiration strikes. It&rsquo;s all about a powerful picture that catches my eye.</p>
<p>How do I know? As they say, you know when you see it. For me, It catches my eye right away. I open it full screen and can&rsquo;t stop looking at it. It&rsquo;s powerful, dynamic, beautiful, tells a story, and has good lines; maybe it&rsquo;s the lighting or shadows, but so many things can make a powerful photo. It&rsquo;s a moment that in real life passes you by in mere seconds, but when you freeze that moment in light and shadow, you give that mere micro-second of time a new life. Your brain has time to process it and, more importantly, to feel it&rsquo;s draw, it&rsquo;s power. A photograph can be one of the most emotionally invoking things we interact with.</p>
<p>Onto the first installment of <em>Exposed To Light</em>:
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Photographer: <a href="https://substack.com/@sinthecity?">S.</a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Camera: iPhone 14 Pro <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Title: S. didn&rsquo;t appear to name the photo; I&rsquo;m calling it Ballet Dancers. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Link: <a href="https://substack.com/profile/15508478-s/note/c-88390101">Ballet Dancers</a> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The light and shadow in this shot are just mesmerizing. The entire range is present with light and shadow. The overall story here is pretty obvious, but the individual and small group stories are not. When you look around at the different expressions and small group chats, you can&rsquo;t help but wonder what they are talking about and feeling. Nervousness, excitement, boredom—you see all the different emotions in the faces. </p>
<p>This is what S. says about the photo: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the best photo I&rsquo;ve ever taken and the client didn&rsquo;t wanna use it. Pls enjoy bc otherwise it will never see the light of day :,)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They give a download link to the photo and tell people to download it and enjoy it. Further in the comments is a short video of the room where the shot was taken. </p>
<p>I think the photo is fantastic.</p>

<p>I used to write/publish photo stories at Exposure.co. It&rsquo;s a nice website, and it&rsquo;s a great place to see other people&rsquo;s work, but it locks your content and locks you into paying every year to have access to your content. I&rsquo;ve had a good engagement over there. I only have four stories there, but they each have 33,000+ views, which is a lot for my work. With that being said, I don&rsquo;t do the things that I do for views, clicks, or money. 
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I&rsquo;ve been moving my digital life to cliff538.com and have downloaded my data for Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Today, I focused on Exposure. How much does it cost a year? Can I download my stories? Do I want this anymore? Keep or delete. 
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Over the years at Exposure I&rsquo;ve been paying $99/year, the lowest tier now is $149/year. I decided to export my content and move it to cliff538.com. Well, guess what, you can&rsquo;t. The only export option is a PDF, only if you pay for Pro Plus, which is $319/year. If I want to export PDFs of my photo stories, I&rsquo;ll have to upgrade my account, download the PDFs, and close my account. But, they throw in some nice warnings; if your stories are over a specific size, you have to be on the business plan at $999/year to export your PDFs. Two, they warn you that the PDFs may not even look good due to pagination issues and that they are working on it. 
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
PDF exports don&rsquo;t help me much because I need to build a web page to recreate my photo stories. This makes me unhappy and reinforces why I&rsquo;m making this move. Own your content, control where it is, and have full backups. Don&rsquo;t be locked into price increases, a lack of export options, or business failures. 
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
So what to do? Well, I&rsquo;m stuck; luckily, there are only four medium-sized stories. I have all the photos; I used Obsidian Web Clipper to clip the pages, which gives me the text between the pictures. Reimagining the stories into web pages for my blog will be time-consuming, but the beauty is that it will be the last time. I&rsquo;ll control how it looks and where it lives.
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I thought about just deleting it but the stories really do have meaning for me. They are from a different time in my life. I wouldnt write the stories the same way today or use the same pictures (some of the HDR makes me cringe) but back then I did, and sometimes it&rsquo;s good to see where you came from.

<p>If you’re publishing your work exclusively on platforms like Instagram, Medium, or Facebook, you’re playing by someone else’s rules. While these platforms provide convenience and exposure, they come with significant risks:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Platform Dependency</strong>: What happens if the platform changes its algorithm, shutters its services, or bans your account? In 2024 alone, over 60% of creators reported revenue losses due to algorithm changes.    
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Monetization Barriers</strong>: Platforms often take a significant cut of your earnings. For instance, YouTube takes up to 45% of ad revenue, and Instagram&rsquo;s monetization options are pay-to-play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Ownership</strong>: The data you’re generating—your audience insights, contact lists, and engagement metrics—belongs to the platform, not you. They profit from it while you’re left in the dark.    
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Censorship and Restrictions</strong>: Platforms can impose restrictions on what you publish, often limiting creativity and expression. If your content doesn’t align with their guidelines, it can be removed or suppressed.<br>

			 <p>Growing up, we rode three-wheelers every day all year long. Over the years, we had the Honda 110, 185, 200, 200X, and finally the 250R, which was scary fast. It was a blast riding on frozen lakes in the winter. I will never forget those times.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In shop class, we learned how to rebuild the motors and, of course, put in higher compression pistons to increase horsepower. Oh, and that dreadful youthful phase of liking loud exhaust pipes&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Our local dealer in town always had brand new ones sitting on the showroom floor, we would go in an and dream about saving enough money from working in the Summer fishing that we could get a new one..</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then, in my twenties, going up North to work, nobody had cars; it was all three-wheelers, four-wheelers, and snowmachines. Honda made the most incredibly reliable engines. People would tear those things up over the years, do very maintenance, and they just kept on going year after year.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was a little sad to watch the three-wheelers phase out and be replaced by the four-wheelers, which were not as fun. I do understand, though. I know the accident rate was high with the three-wheelers, but that was mostly user error, not being properly trained in the limitations and idiosyncrasies of the machine, and riding one way too powerful for your skills. Growing up, with all the riding we all did, nobody was seriously hurt by them, but we had plenty of auto accidents/deaths.</p>
<p>Some final facts from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Honda’s dominance in the ATC market peaked in 1984, with 370,000 units shipped and a 69% market share. In 1985, Honda offered their most diverse lineup, with ten models available. However, due to safety concerns, production of three-wheelers was voluntarily ceased by all manufacturers by 1987. ￼
These models played a significant role in popularizing ATCs and contributed to the development of the modern ATV industry.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is mostly how you find them now:</p>

<p>This has been a struggle for me in the past. I often found myself running out of books and searching for something new to read, which led me to browse bookstores. Each visit is a wonderful experience; independent shops have a unique charm, often showcasing local authors, and the smell of books is irreplaceable. However, there were times when I left empty-handed, without anything that sparked my interest.</p>
<p>To tackle this, having a collection of online tools for discovering books is essential. Here are some ideas that may inspire you.</p>
<p>Now, I face a new challenge: a to-read list that keeps expanding, which is, in fact, a wonderful problem to have. I used to feel overwhelmed by this, but I&rsquo;ve learned to embrace the reality that countless books will always remain out of reach. That’s why it’s so important to focus on reading what you love. Don’t linger on a book that feels just okay; there are countless extraordinary stories waiting for you. And don’t let that ever-growing pile of unread books weigh you down; it’s always there with your next book!</p>
<p>I will continue to add to this list with your suggestions and any helpful resources I come across. Please email or comment with your favorites, and I’ll include them.</p>

I haven&rsquo;t tried any of their e-readers, as the iPhone/iPad apps are enough for me. I&rsquo;ve heard really good things about them on Reddit.

<p>These are two of my favorite pictures. I was extremely lucky to be driving down the highway and catch these guys working in the hills. I had my 200-500mm lens, which allowed me to take these shots. It was all shot out the window. I sat there for hours, watching these guys work. I would like to do this after I retire. I respect these pilots greatly. I was able to contact the pilots via social media and made sure they received copies of the prints.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a Waking Up meditation app user, and Sam had a good New Year resolution conceptual frame to place around everything in 2025. I’m paraphrasing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Filter everything you do this year through the lens that this is your last year of life. It’s a clarifier of sorts, a filter for what you will do and not do. Would I do this? Would I care about this? Would I pay attention to this? A great example was, would you take the time to watch a lousy movie alone? Certainly not. How about watching a bad movie with your kids? Absolutely yes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time with family, even during a bad movie, is precious. We will all have our own do’s and don’t do’s, but It struck me and made me think really hard about the things I’m going to do in 2025. </p>
<p>You can listen to the whole 8 min message <a href="https://dynamic.wakingup.com/course/CO284C5?source=content%20share&amp;share_id=6F9A3E1D&amp;code=SC2475C82">here</a>.</p>
<p>Another great post about some life lessons and what you can apply to this new year comes from Maria Popova with her post <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/10/22/marginalian-18/">18 Life-Learnings from 18 Years of the Marginalian</a>.  I love how beautifully she writes. I&rsquo;m striving for many things on her list, like #14, &ldquo;Choose Joy,&rdquo; and #13, &ldquo;In any bond of depth and significance, forgive, forgive, forgive. And then forgive again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wishing you all a fulfilling and productive 2025 filled with joy. Cheers.</p>

<p>Welcome to cliff538.com, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>The scaffolding is up, and the orange cones are out. We are fully under construction (<em>well, aren&rsquo;t we all. It&rsquo;s a process&hellip; even at 55+ years old, I&rsquo;m still under construction</em>). Lots of changes coming as I figure out this Hugo blog generator and dust off some ancient HTML and CSS skills. This is my main landing page and a small blog for everyday stuff (<em>I think, maybe just a landing page. Keep it simple, Cliff&hellip;</em>), along with my micro.blog. The primary blogging will be done over at Exposed To Want.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know about design yet and how this is going to work, but that&rsquo;s half the fun, figuring all this stuff out!</p>
<p>My life quote right now is attributed to Rene Descartes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You just keep pushing. You just keep pushing. I made every mistake that could be made. But I just kept pushing&quot; </p>

The M4 chip and the Retina XDR display at 1000/1600 nits is just beautiful. I&rsquo;ve had zero performance issues using FCP or editing pictures. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve never used a keyboard with an iPad before and was pretty skeptical. I forced myself to keep it attached for 30 days, and now I can&rsquo;t imagine using the iPad without it. It&rsquo;s a perfect built-in stand, and for reading in bed using the iPad in a vertical position, I can use the keyboard as a light-blocking aid. I find myself using the iPad way more at home for writing than the laptop. But, there have been some awkward moments using the laptop after the iPad and trying to touch the screen&hellip;</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->iPhone 16 Pro<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is worth it just for the big bump in battery life, especially if you&rsquo;ll shoot a lot of video.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple Inteligence<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, meh. I&rsquo;m not using it much. As I&rsquo;ve talked about before, I&rsquo;m a terrible writer, and I use Grammarly extensively to fix my horrible punctuation, spelling, and structure. Trying to use Apple Intelligence is just not user-friendly, and it doesn&rsquo;t show you what it has changed; it just shows the whole paragraph rewritten, not what has changed. The one stand-out is using ChatGPT through Siri. One, it&rsquo;s free and private if you don&rsquo;t log into your account, and Two, you can log into your account if you have one, and it will log everything in your ChatGPT account for future reference. One nice trick is using ChatGPT through Siri with your voice after you get the response back, you can ask Siri to make a note out of the response so you can refer back to it, or it will disappear. Hopefully, Apple will kick up its adoption speed a notch or two.

<li>Find a new second monitor. I&rsquo;m using a Studio Display as the main display, and I have a now very old 30&quot; Apple Cinema Display that still surprises me that it still works. It&rsquo;s around 17 years old. Doing a lot of tutorials and video/photo editing, the second monitor is priceless.

<li>Read and support more small independent news sources like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->404 Media<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and the numerous independent journalists on Substack. There is a wave of exodus of talent from major news outlets now that they can make a living writing on Substack, Beehiiv, Ghost, etc. That freedom to say what you want when you want has got to be refreshing. We are experiencing significant changes in mainstream media, and I believe 2025 will be a very tumultuous year. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
