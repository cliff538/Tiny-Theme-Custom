Added a &ldquo;cliff538 Photography&rdquo; page with links to photo sets (only one set as of now), But I like the way <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> has built this in. You can adjust the photo sets with custom CSS, and the large viewer is really nice. The only set right now is Land Yachts, if you don&rsquo;t know, check it out.</p>

			 <p>Growing up, we rode three-wheelers every day all year long. Over the years, we had the Honda 110, 185, 200, 200X, and finally the 250R, which was scary fast. It was a blast riding on frozen lakes in the winter. I will never forget those times.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In shop class, we learned how to rebuild the motors and, of course, put in higher compression pistons to increase horsepower. Oh, and that dreadful youthful phase of liking loud exhaust pipes&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Our local dealer in town always had brand new ones sitting on the showroom floor, we would go in an and dream about saving enough money from working in the Summer fishing that we could get a new one..</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then, in my twenties, going up North to work, nobody had cars; it was all three-wheelers, four-wheelers, and snowmachines. Honda made the most incredibly reliable engines. People would tear those things up over the years, do very maintenance, and they just kept on going year after year.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was a little sad to watch the three-wheelers phase out and be replaced by the four-wheelers, which were not as fun. I do understand, though. I know the accident rate was high with the three-wheelers, but that was mostly user error, not being properly trained in the limitations and idiosyncrasies of the machine, and riding one way too powerful for your skills. Growing up, with all the riding we all did, nobody was seriously hurt by them, but we had plenty of auto accidents/deaths.</p>
<p>Some final facts from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hondaâ€™s dominance in the ATC market peaked in 1984, with 370,000 units shipped and a 69% market share. In 1985, Honda offered their most diverse lineup, with ten models available. However, due to safety concerns, production of three-wheelers was voluntarily ceased by all manufacturers by 1987. ï¿¼
These models played a significant role in popularizing ATCs and contributed to the development of the modern ATV industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly, this is mostly how you find them now:</p>

<p>This has been a struggle for me in the past. I often found myself running out of books and searching for something new to read, which led me to browse bookstores. Each visit is a wonderful experience; independent shops have a unique charm, often showcasing local authors, and the smell of books is irreplaceable. However, there were times when I left empty-handed, without anything that sparked my interest.</p>
<p>To tackle this, having a collection of online tools for discovering books is essential. Here are some ideas that may inspire you.</p>
<p>Now, I face a new challenge: a to-read list that keeps expanding, which is, in fact, a wonderful problem to have. I used to feel overwhelmed by this, but I&rsquo;ve learned to embrace the reality that countless books will always remain out of reach. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s so important to focus on reading what you love. Donâ€™t linger on a book that feels just okay; there are countless extraordinary stories waiting for you. And donâ€™t let that ever-growing pile of unread books weigh you down; itâ€™s always there with your next book!</p>
<p>I will continue to add to this list with your suggestions and any helpful resources I come across. Please email or comment with your favorites, and Iâ€™ll include them.

<p>These are two of my favorite pictures. I was extremely lucky to be driving down the highway and catch these guys working in the hills. I had my 200-500mm lens, which allowed me to take these shots. It was all shot out the window. I sat there for hours, watching these guys work. I would like to do this after I retire. I respect these pilots greatly. I was able to contact the pilots via social media and made sure they received copies of the prints.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a Waking Up meditation app user, and Sam had a good New Year resolution conceptual frame to place around everything in 2025. Iâ€™m paraphrasing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Filter everything you do this year through the lens that this is your last year of life. Itâ€™s a clarifier of sorts, a filter for what you will do and not do. Would I do this? Would I care about this? Would I pay attention to this? A great example was, would you take the time to watch a lousy movie alone? Certainly not. How about watching a bad movie with your kids? Absolutely yes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time with family, even during a bad movie, is precious. We will all have our own doâ€™s and donâ€™t doâ€™s, but It struck me and made me think really hard about the things Iâ€™m going to do in 2025.Â </p>
<p>You can listen to the whole 8 min message <a href="https://dynamic.wakingup.com/course/CO284C5?source=content%20share&amp;share_id=6F9A3E1D&amp;code=SC2475C82">here</a>.</p>
<p>Another great post about some life lessons and what you can apply to this new year comes from Maria Popova with her post <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2024/10/22/marginalian-18/">18 Life-Learnings from 18 Years of the Marginalian</a>.  I love how beautifully she writes. I&rsquo;m striving for many things on her list, like #14, &ldquo;Choose Joy,&rdquo; and #13, &ldquo;In any bond of depth and significance, forgive, forgive, forgive. And then forgive again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wishing you all a fulfilling and productive 2025 filled with joy. Cheers.</p>

<p>Welcome to cliff538.com, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re here.</p>
<p>The scaffolding is up, and the orange cones are out. We are fully under construction (<em>well, aren&rsquo;t we all. It&rsquo;s a process&hellip; even at 55+ years old, I&rsquo;m still under construction</em>). Lots of changes coming as I figure out this Hugo blog generator and dust off some ancient HTML and CSS skills. This is my main landing page and a small blog for everyday stuff (<em>I think, maybe just a landing page. Keep it simple, Cliff&hellip;</em>), along with my micro.blog. The primary blogging will be done over at Exposed To Want.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know about design yet and how this is going to work, but that&rsquo;s half the fun, figuring all this stuff out!</p>
<p>My life quote right now is from Rene Descartes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>â€œYou just keep pushing. You just keep pushing. I made every mistake that could be made. But I just kept pushing&quot;Â </p>
