				"content_html": "<p>There are endless blog posts about the latest to-do apps and systems. My goal is not to proclaim from the rooftops that I&rsquo;ve found the secret to daily planning success but to share some thoughts on a few options that I have found very rewarding.</p>\n<p>I have a <em>constant</em> struggle with Analog vs Digital; it perturbs me how much I think about this. I&rsquo;ve given up worrying about which type of system it is, and I do what feels right and what keeps me on track. And, if that system brings a little joy to the process, even better.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been a <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/things/\">Things</a> app user for years now and love it. It&rsquo;s quick and easy on all my devices and syncs well. It&rsquo;s always on my desktop at home as a gentle reminder to keep me on track for the day. My problem with it is planning my week or my day. Things is an ever-growing constant list that mostly sits stagnant, and I have little interaction with it on a daily basis. I&rsquo;ve tried building my day in calendar apps, and that works, but they don&rsquo;t stay open. I close them at some point, and the day aimlessly drifts off down rabbit holes. One requirement I&rsquo;ve found is that the day planner must <em>always</em> be visible.</p>\n<p>When planning my week and day, I was missing something and wasn&rsquo;t staying on track throughout the day. It&rsquo;s all there in Things, but I don&rsquo;t have any draw to it; I can&rsquo;t touch it or grab it and alter it. I&rsquo;m primarily digital, but I need/crave some pen and paper touch—not too much, though; I&rsquo;ve tried paper journaling, and that&rsquo;s too much. I love journaling in <a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com\">DayOne</a>.</p>\n<p>Enter <a href=\"https://ugmonk.com\">Ugmonk</a>. First, this is not a cheap system upfront, but by the time you read this, they will have a much more affordable metal version for sale (launching February 19th, 2025), which has been much needed. Also, this system is not complex; you could easily make your own with some woodworking skills or a 3D printer and 3x5 cards. The cost for me is worth it; it brings me a little joy, it looks great sitting on the desk, and I&rsquo;ve stayed on track better throughout the day.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been using the system for over a month and love it. I&rsquo;m still not sold on using the weekly and daily views together, but for now, it&rsquo;s both. It comes down to how your brain works and what you need to see. I&rsquo;m a person with an odd job. I&rsquo;m away from home for 3 to 4 days a week. So, when I&rsquo;m home, I need to see what is left of my week and what I want to accomplish that day. I never know what day of the week or day of the month it is; it just doesn&rsquo;t matter to me. I have large calendar widgets on all my devices to help me remember. All I want to know, what I need to know, is how many days off I have until I go back to work and what I want to get done on those days.</p>\n<p>I use the weekly card for this. On my first day off, I grab a fresh card and my favorite pen and map out my week in broad strokes; it sits on my desk, so I&rsquo;m constantly reminded. Then, each day, I formulate a plan with the daily card.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>There is something special about grabbing that thick, beautiful paper and writing on it with your favorite pen. It gives substance to the plan; it sinks it just a little bit deeper into memory by writing it out. It makes me smile; it brings just a little joy, and I like that. Plus, I always have paper to quickly grab to make quick notes using the backside of the weekly or daily card. When done with the day or the week, I can store them away, or I&rsquo;ve been using them for bookmarks.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>As an option to this analog version, I just learned about <a href=\"https://tweek.so\">Tweek</a>. I&rsquo;ve used this alongside my Ugmonk/Things system just for testing. I think Tweek is really cool; I wish I had come up with it. If I ever want to drop Ugmonk, I&rsquo;d go with Tweek. They have full function under their free plan, so you can test it to see if it fits into your world. But it&rsquo;s sterile for me; I need some analog, I need to touch some nice paper, and I need to use my favorite pen. I need that little piece of joy to start my day, the constant visual reminder, and that satisfaction of marking off an item with my Sharpie.</p>\n<p>I hope some of this helps you with your task list. Thank you, as always, for visiting my little piece of the web.

I've tried building my day in calendar apps, and that works, but they don't stay open. I close them at some point, and the day aimlessly drifts off down rabbit holes. One requirement I've found is that the day planner must _always_ be visible. \n\nWhen planning my week and day, I was missing something and wasn't staying on track throughout the day. It's all there in Things, but I don't have any draw to it; I can't touch it or grab it and alter it. I'm primarily digital, but I need/crave some pen and paper touch—not too much, though; I've tried paper journaling, and that's too much. I love journaling in [DayOne](https://dayoneapp.com). \n\nEnter [Ugmonk](https://ugmonk.com). First, this is not a cheap system upfront, but by the time you read this, they will have a much more affordable metal version for sale (launching February 19th, 2025), which has been much needed. Also, this system is not complex; you could easily make your own with some woodworking skills or a 3D printer and 3x5 cards. The cost for me is worth it; it brings me a little joy, it looks great sitting on the desk, and I've stayed on track better throughout the day. \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/ugmonk-week.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"708\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A desk planner with a pen is placed on a table in front of a black briefcase.\">\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/ugmonk-day.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"710\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A wooden stand holds a notepad with a list template, placed on a wooden surface next to a pen and stacked boxes.\">\n\nI've been using the system for over a month and love it. I'm still not sold on using the weekly and daily views together, but for now, it's both. It comes down to how your brain works and what you need to see. I'm a person with an odd job. I'm away from home for 3 to 4 days a week. So, when I'm home, I need to see what is left of my week and what I want to accomplish that day. I never know what day of the week or day of the month it is; it just doesn't matter to me. I have large calendar widgets on all my devices to help me remember. All I want to know, what I need to know, is how many days off I have until I go back to work and what I want to get done on those days. \n\nI use the weekly card for this. On my first day off, I grab a fresh card and my favorite pen and map out my week in broad strokes; it sits on my desk, so I'm constantly reminded. Then, each day, I formulate a plan with the daily card. \n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/my-ugmonk-week.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A desk features a container of pens and markers, an open weekly planner in a wooden holder, a portion of a keyboard, and a mouse pad.\">\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/my-ugmonk-day.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A to-do list placed on a wooden holder sits on a desk near a computer, with a small card featuring colorful icons nearby.\">\n\nThere is something special about grabbing that thick, beautiful paper and writing on it with your favorite pen. It gives substance to the plan; it sinks it just a little bit deeper into memory by writing it out. It makes me smile; it brings just a little joy, and I like that. Plus, I always have paper to quickly grab to make quick notes using the backside of the weekly or daily card. When done with the day or the week, I can store them away, or I've been using them for bookmarks. \n\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/tweek-week.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"261\" alt=\"Auto-generated description: A digital calendar displaying a weekly schedule for February 2025 is set against a gradient background.\">\n\n\nAs an option to this analog version, I just learned about [Tweek](https://tweek.so). I've used this alongside my Ugmonk/Things system just for testing. I think Tweek is really cool; I wish I had come up with it. If I ever want to drop Ugmonk, I'd go with Tweek. They have full function under their free plan, so you can test it to see if it fits into your world. But it's sterile for me; I need some analog, I need to touch some nice paper, and I need to use my favorite pen. I need that little piece of joy to start my day, the constant visual reminder, and that satisfaction of marking off an item with my Sharpie. \n\nI hope some of this helps you with your task list. Thank you, as always, for visiting my little piece of the web. Cheers! \n\n\n[Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/)\n\n[Ugmonk](https://ugmonk.com)\n\n[tweek.so](https://tweek.so)\n\n\n",

While these platforms provide convenience and exposure, they come with significant risks:\n<br>\n1. **Platform Dependency**: What happens if the platform changes its algorithm, shutters its services, or bans your account? In 2024 alone, over 60% of creators reported revenue losses due to algorithm changes.    \n<br>\n2. **Monetization Barriers**: Platforms often take a significant cut of your earnings. For instance, YouTube takes up to 45% of ad revenue, and Instagram's monetization options are pay-to-play.   \n\n3. **Data Ownership**: The data you’re generating—your audience insights, contact lists, and engagement metrics—belongs to the platform, not you. They profit from it while you’re left in the dark.    \n<br>\n4. **Censorship and Restrictions**: Platforms can impose restrictions on what you publish, often limiting creativity and expression. If your content doesn’t align with their guidelines, it can be removed or suppressed.   \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<h3>The Benefits of Owning Your Platform</h3>\nBy running your blog or website, you remove the middleman and take full control of your content and audience. Here’s what you gain:\n1. **Full Creative Control**: Publish what you want, how you want, without fear of censorship.    \n2. **Data Ownership**: Collect and control your audience data directly, enabling better relationships and monetization strategies.    \n3. **Longevity**: Platforms come and go, but your self-hosted blog can remain online indefinitely, ensuring your creations outlive any trend or corporate decision.    \n4. **Custom Branding**: Unlike third-party platforms, your blog reflects your unique identity, free from distracting ads or conflicting branding.\n<br>\n<br>\n<h3>Debunking the Technical Barrier Myth</h3>\nMany creators hesitate to start their blog because they fear it’s too technical or expensive. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Modern tools like WordPress, Hugo, and Micro.blog make self-hosting more accessible than ever. Here’s a simple roadmap to get started:\n1. **Buy a Domain**: Use a registrar like Hover.com to purchase a custom domain for as little as $10/year.    \n2. **Choose a Hosting Platform**: Services like SiteGround, Micro.blog, or Netlify offer affordable options.    \n3. **Start Writing**: With pre-built templates and easy-to-use tools, you can be up and running in a matter of hours.    \n<br>\n<br>\n<h3>The Numbers Don’t Lie</h3>\nThe shift toward self-hosting is gaining momentum:\n- **45% of creators** plan to invest in self-hosted platforms by 2026.    \n- **70% of internet users** express concerns about how platforms handle their data.    \n- **Domain registrations for personal websites** rose by 30% in 2023.    \n<br>\n<br>\n<h3>Call to Action: Own Your Digital Future</h3>\nOwning your content isn’t just about control; it’s about building a digital future that belongs to you. Stop renting your ideas on platforms that profit from your creativity. Start your own blog today, and take the first step toward true creative independence.\n<br>\n<br>\nHere are some resources to get started:    \n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">The Micro.blog Platform</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo Static Site Generator</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<br>\nYour creations deserve a permanent home. Give them one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I don't use this site because the same features are built into Micro Blog, but it looks excellent for tracking your lists: Currently Reading, To Read, and Read, making custom Bookshelves, and reading other people's book reviews. If I didn't have Micro Blog, I'd be here. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n\n### Library Tools\n\n[OverDrive/Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/) - Free ebooks, audiobooks & magazines from your local library.  \nYou only need a public library card or access through your workplace or university.

One nice trick is using ChatGPT through Siri with your voice after you get the response back, you can ask Siri to make a note out of the response so you can refer back to it, or it will disappear.

				"content_text": "<h2><strong>Reading</strong></h2>\n\n<p>I'm happy with my reading this year. The number of books is not\nessential other than reading a lot keeps your attention span sharp. I\nhave noticed over the years that with social media and everything on the\ninternet being short, whether it’s videos or articles, my ability to\nfocus on something deeply for long periods is rusty. Learning to slow\ndown and reign in the monkey brain is an ongoing exercise. I find the\nbiggest benefit in meditation, reading books, and limiting social media\nand the doom scrolling. <br />Also, my books-to-read list is way longer\nthan I have time for, and the more books I can read, the further I can\nexpose myself to beautiful writing, distant worlds, and deeper human\nconnections.</p>\n\n<p>The goal every year is always around 15-20 books. This year was 33\nreads, with several others abandoned. I used to feel bad about giving up\non a book and felt like you should finish it if you started it.  No way;\nthere are too many great books out there. Don’t waste your time with\nsomething that doesn’t speak to you somehow.</p>\n\n<p>Variety this year was good. That is an important goal every year to not\nget stuck in a category. There is a vast array of well-written books out\nthere, and I want to expose myself to all I can. A few areas of lacking\nis Poetry. I've always struggled with it and find it hard to appreciate.\nPlease let me know if you have any good poetry starter books you can\nrecommend. Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>Every year, I waffle back and forth about reading new material or mixing\nin some favorite books from the past that I would like to re-read. The\ndeciding factor has always been if I can't find enough new material,\nthat's a perfect excuse to pull something from the past. But I've never\nhad a problem finding new material. Alas, the struggle continues.</p>\n\n<p>That brings me to the art of finding new books. I'll discuss more later;\nI'm working on a blog post about just that.</p>\n\n<p>I was going to pontificate about which books were my favorites and what\nI learned, etc. But as you can see by my average rating of 4.7 stars, I\nenjoyed them all, LOL. Maybe I need to expand my rating scale some ; )\n<br />Honestly, I abandoned multiple books that I couldn't slog through.\nSo if I finished it, I enjoyed it. 2025 will hopefully bring a mini-book\nreport on each book next year. It will take discipline. When I started\nusing Obsidian, the goal was to write about each book when I finished\nit. Well, I read 33 books, and I have six book reviews. That shows you\nwhat I'm up against.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: There are two books below where the covers did not populate.\n<br />1) The Reign of Wolf 21: The Saga of Yellowstone's Legendary Druid\nPack by Rick McIntyre.

The M4 chip and the Retina XDR display at 1000/1600 nits is just beautiful. I've had zero performance issues using FCP or editing pictures. <br />I've never used a keyboard with an iPad before and was pretty skeptical. I forced myself to keep it attached for 30 days, and now I can't imagine using the iPad without it. It's a perfect built-in stand, and for reading in bed using the iPad in a vertical position, I can use the keyboard as a light-blocking aid. I find myself using the iPad way more at home for writing than the laptop. But, there have been some awkward moments using the laptop after the iPad and trying to touch the screen... \n\n<em>iPhone 16 Pro</em> is worth it just for the big bump in battery life, especially if you'll shoot a lot of video. \n\n<em>Apple Inteligence</em>, meh. I'm not using it much. As I've talked about before, I'm a terrible writer, and I use Grammarly extensively to fix my horrible punctuation, spelling, and structure. Trying to use Apple Intelligence is just not user-friendly, and it doesn't show you what it has changed; it just shows the whole paragraph rewritten, not what has changed. The one stand-out is using ChatGPT through Siri. One, it's free and private if you don't log into your account, and Two, you can log into your account if you have one, and it will log everything in your ChatGPT account for future reference. One nice trick is using ChatGPT through Siri with your voice after you get the response back, you can ask Siri to make a note out of the response so you can refer back to it, or it will disappear. Hopefully, Apple will kick up its adoption speed a notch or two. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<br /><strong>Misc</strong>: <br />1. I stopped using Kagi and Google for search. ChatGPT (free version) works amazingly well.<br />2. Done with Twitter. <em>Done</em>. I did not delete my account, but I have not posted or read for a long time. I've found my home at Mastodon.<br />3. I started a blog! \n<br>\n<br>\n<h2><strong>Goals for 2025</strong></h2>\n\n1. 20+ books, a wide variety of genres, and if the book is noteworthy, blog about it. I'm considering an outline like Key Points, Personal Impact, and Action Items. \n<br />\n2. Stay healthy; eat even better, train more, reduce stress, smile more, and look at the bright side. <em>(in your fifties, your check engine light comes on, and the sins of youth come back to haunt you.)</em>\n<br />\n3. Start some sort of music outlet. Pick an instrument and take some lessons. \n<br />\n4. Save. Save. Save. Retirement is just around the corner. \n<br />\n5. Keep searching for that perfect <em>(adequate, best you can, clumsy, awkward)</em> Work/Life balance. \n<br />\n6. Find a new second monitor. I'm using a Studio Display as the main display, and I have a now very old 30\" Apple Cinema Display that still surprises me that it still works. It's around 17 years old. Doing a lot of tutorials and video/photo editing, the second monitor is priceless. \n<br />\n7. Read and support more small independent news sources like <a href=\"https://www.404media.co\">404 Media</a> and the numerous independent journalists on Substack. There is a wave of exodus of talent from major news outlets now that they can make a living writing on Substack, Beehiiv, Ghost, etc. That freedom to say what you want when you want has got to be refreshing. We are experiencing significant changes in mainstream media, and I believe 2025 will be a very tumultuous year. <hr />\n<br />Where do you stop with this stuff, I could futz with this post for weeks. It's gotta end somewhere. This is the end. Here is to an Amazing 2025. <em>(please, please, please, don't let America self-implode; it's only December, and they are already off to a rocky start... I need to add: read less politics under 2025 Goals.)<br /></em><em><hr /></em><em>\n\n</em>Let's end with a Carl Sagan Quote for some much-needed perspective. \n<br>\n<figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview flex-col justify-center attachment--jpg\">\n      <img class=\"lightbox--image\" srcset=\"https://scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcC9jIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--614ab55b263e9f57a02edfae88c4730f19d3b30f/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUVHa0NBQXc2Q25OaGRtVnlld1k2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwWkE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--556deb252b4ed95e4b10b8bc1ed8e2d68a7b2d43/2024-12-28-10.05-photo.jpg 2x\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Famous Pale Blue Dot Photo taken by NASA\" src=\"https://scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcC9jIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--614ab55b263e9f57a02edfae88c4730f19d3b30f/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJYW5CbkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUNHa0NBQVk2Q25OaGRtVnlld1k2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwWkE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--77b85d2deaa725665407f11c49ec672491c1f59c/2024-12-28-10.05-photo.jpg\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"attachment__caption text-center\">\n      By NASA/JPL-Caltech - [photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA2...](https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA23645.jpg,) Public Domain, [commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.p...](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=86976246)\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<br>\n<br>\nPale Blue Dot is a photo of Earth that was taken by the Voyager 1 space probe in 1990 from a distance of about 6 billion kilometers (3.7 billion miles) as it was leaving our solar system. This is what Carl Sagan said about the photo:\n<br>\n\n<blockquote>\"Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor, and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every 'superstar,' every 'supreme leader,' every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there — on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment, the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.”  \n\n~ Carl Sagan</blockquote>\n\n\n",
