While these platforms provide convenience and exposure, they come with significant risks:\n<br>\n1. **Platform Dependency**: What happens if the platform changes its algorithm, shutters its services, or bans your account? In 2024 alone, over 60% of creators reported revenue losses due to algorithm changes.   ¬†\n<br>\n2. **Monetization Barriers**: Platforms often take a significant cut of your earnings. For instance, YouTube takes up to 45% of ad revenue, and Instagram's monetization options are pay-to-play.   \n\n3. **Data Ownership**: The data you‚Äôre generating‚Äîyour audience insights, contact lists, and engagement metrics‚Äîbelongs to the platform, not you. They profit from it while you‚Äôre left in the dark.   ¬†\n<br>\n4. **Censorship and Restrictions**: Platforms can impose restrictions on what you publish, often limiting creativity and expression. If your content doesn‚Äôt align with their guidelines, it can be removed or suppressed.   \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<h3>The Benefits of Owning Your Platform</h3>\nBy running your blog or website, you remove the middleman and take full control of your content and audience. Here‚Äôs what you gain:\n1. **Full Creative Control**: Publish what you want, how you want, without fear of censorship.   ¬†\n2. **Data Ownership**: Collect and control your audience data directly, enabling better relationships and monetization strategies.   ¬†\n3. **Longevity**: Platforms come and go, but your self-hosted blog can remain online indefinitely, ensuring your creations outlive any trend or corporate decision.   ¬†\n4. **Custom Branding**: Unlike third-party platforms, your blog reflects your unique identity, free from distracting ads or conflicting branding.\n<br>\n<br>\n<h3>Debunking the Technical Barrier Myth</h3>\nMany creators hesitate to start their blog because they fear it‚Äôs too technical or expensive. This couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. Modern tools like WordPress, Hugo, and Micro.blog make self-hosting more accessible than ever. Here‚Äôs a simple roadmap to get started:\n1. **Buy a Domain**: Use a registrar like Hover.com to purchase a custom domain for as little as $10/year.   ¬†\n2. **Choose a Hosting Platform**: Services like SiteGround, Micro.blog, or Netlify offer affordable options.   ¬†\n3. **Start Writing**: With pre-built templates and easy-to-use tools, you can be up and running in a matter of hours.   ¬†\n<br>\n<br>\n<h3>The Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie</h3>\nThe shift toward self-hosting is gaining momentum:\n- **45% of creators**¬†plan to invest in self-hosted platforms by 2026.   ¬†\n- **70% of internet users**¬†express concerns about how platforms handle their data.   ¬†\n- **Domain registrations for personal websites**¬†rose by 30% in 2023.   ¬†\n<br>\n<br>\n<h3>Call to Action: Own Your Digital Future</h3>\nOwning your content isn‚Äôt just about control; it‚Äôs about building a digital future that belongs to you. Stop renting your ideas on platforms that profit from your creativity. Start your own blog today, and take the first step toward true creative independence.\n<br>\n<br>\nHere are some resources to get started:   ¬†\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://micro.blog/\">The Micro.blog Platform</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo Static Site Generator</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<br>\nYour creations deserve a permanent home. Give them one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I often found myself running out of books and searching for something new to read, which led me to browse bookstores. Each visit is a wonderful experience; independent shops have a unique charm, often showcasing local authors, and the smell of books is irreplaceable. However, there were times when I left empty-handed, without anything that sparked my interest.\n\nTo tackle this, having a collection of online tools for discovering books is essential. Here are some ideas that may inspire you.\n\nNow, I face a new challenge: a to-read list that keeps expanding, which is, in fact, a wonderful problem to have. I used to feel overwhelmed by this, but I've learned to embrace the reality that countless books will always remain out of reach. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to focus on reading what you love. Don‚Äôt linger on a book that feels just okay; there are countless extraordinary stories waiting for you. And don‚Äôt let that ever-growing pile of unread books weigh you down; it‚Äôs always there with your next book!\n\nI will continue to add to this list with your suggestions and any helpful resources I come across.

				"content_text": "<h2><strong>Reading</strong></h2>\n\n<p>I'm happy with my reading this year. The number of books is not\nessential other than reading a lot keeps your attention span sharp. I\nhave noticed over the years that with social media and everything on the\ninternet being short, whether it‚Äôs videos or articles, my ability to\nfocus on something deeply for long periods is rusty. Learning to slow\ndown and reign in the monkey brain is an ongoing exercise. I find the\nbiggest benefit in meditation, reading books, and limiting social media\nand the doom scrolling. <br />Also, my books-to-read list is way longer\nthan I have time for, and the more books I can read, the further I can\nexpose myself to beautiful writing, distant worlds, and deeper human\nconnections.</p>\n\n<p>The goal every year is always around 15-20 books. This year was 33\nreads, with several others abandoned. I used to feel bad about giving up\non a book and felt like you should finish it if you started it.¬† No way;\nthere are too many great books out there. Don‚Äôt waste your time with\nsomething that doesn‚Äôt speak to you somehow.</p>\n\n<p>Variety this year was good. That is an important goal every year to not\nget stuck in a category. There is a vast array of well-written books out\nthere, and I want to expose myself to all I can. A few areas of lacking\nis Poetry. I've always struggled with it and find it hard to appreciate.\nPlease let me know if you have any good poetry starter books you can\nrecommend. Thank you!</p>\n\n<p>Every year, I waffle back and forth about reading new material or mixing\nin some favorite books from the past that I would like to re-read. The\ndeciding factor has always been if I can't find enough new material,\nthat's a perfect excuse to pull something from the past. But I've never\nhad a problem finding new material. Alas, the struggle continues.</p>\n\n<p>That brings me to the art of finding new books. I'll discuss more later;\nI'm working on a blog post about just that.</p>\n\n<p>I was going to pontificate about which books were my favorites and what\nI learned, etc. But as you can see by my average rating of 4.7 stars, I\nenjoyed them all, LOL. Maybe I need to expand my rating scale some ; )\n<br />Honestly, I abandoned multiple books that I couldn't slog through.\nSo if I finished it, I enjoyed it. 2025 will hopefully bring a mini-book\nreport on each book next year. It will take discipline. When I started\nusing Obsidian, the goal was to write about each book when I finished\nit. Well, I read 33 books, and I have six book reviews. That shows you\nwhat I'm up against.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: There are two books below where the covers did not populate.\n<br />1) The Reign of Wolf 21: The Saga of Yellowstone's Legendary Druid\nPack by Rick McIntyre. It's an excellent book, by the way; I can\nrecommend his whole series. <br />2) Killing the Witches: The Horror of\nSalem, Massachusetts, by Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard. </em></p>\n\n<figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview flex-col justify-center attachment--png\">\n      <img class=\"lightbox--image\" srcset=\"https://scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBczdYIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--f64f474d69e7541e5421ed1495b32dad5745f34f/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUVHa0NBQXc2Q25OaGRtVnlld1k2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwWkE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--4bd09cebc84a745407911499177c402d3c45bfea/GoodReads2024Review.png 2x\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Goodreads 2024 My Books in Review\" src=\"https://scribbles.page/rails/active_storage/representations/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBczdYIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--f64f474d69e7541e5421ed1495b32dad5745f34f/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDRG9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUNHa0NBQVk2Q25OaGRtVnlld1k2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwWkE9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--9b3ff7424923b92e765ab2843c07c62ea3d7905e/GoodReads2024Review.png\" />\n    <figcaption class=\"attachment__caption text-center\">\n      GoodReads 2024 Year in Review\n    </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2><strong>Flying</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Flighty says:¬†</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>205 flights</li>\n<li>154,355 miles traveled, which equals 18 days and 1 hour spent sitting in an aluminum tube.¬†</li>\n<li>6.2x around the Earth</li>\n<li>0.6x to the Moon (I wouldn't pass up a chance to go to our moon)¬†</li>\n<li>0.0007x to Mars (I don't want to go to Mars; I'll let the Billionaires have all that glory)</li>\n<li>40 airports¬†</li>\n<li>1 airline</li>\n<li>Shortest Flight was 174 miles PSP - LAS¬†</li>\n<li>Longest Flight was 1,767 miles CMH - LAS¬†</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />It was a good year flying, instructing, and checking.

The M4 chip and the Retina XDR display at 1000/1600 nits is just beautiful. I've had zero performance issues using FCP or editing pictures. <br />I've never used a keyboard with an iPad before and was pretty skeptical. I forced myself to keep it attached for 30 days, and now I can't imagine using the iPad without it. It's a perfect built-in stand, and for reading in bed using the iPad in a vertical position, I can use the keyboard as a light-blocking aid. I find myself using the iPad way more at home for writing than the laptop. But, there have been some awkward moments using the laptop after the iPad and trying to touch the screen... \n\n<em>iPhone 16 Pro</em> is worth it just for the big bump in battery life, especially if you'll shoot a lot of video. \n\n<em>Apple Inteligence</em>, meh. I'm not using it much. As I've talked about before, I'm a terrible writer, and I use Grammarly extensively to fix my horrible punctuation, spelling, and structure. Trying to use Apple Intelligence is just not user-friendly, and it doesn't show you what it has changed; it just shows the whole paragraph rewritten, not what has changed. The one stand-out is using ChatGPT through Siri. One, it's free and private if you don't log into your account, and Two, you can log into your account if you have one, and it will log everything in your ChatGPT account for future reference. One nice trick is using ChatGPT through Siri with your voice after you get the response back, you can ask Siri to make a note out of the response so you can refer back to it, or it will disappear. Hopefully, Apple will kick up its adoption speed a notch or two. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n<br /><strong>Misc</strong>: <br />1. I stopped using Kagi and Google for search. ChatGPT (free version) works amazingly well.<br />2. Done with Twitter. <em>Done</em>. I did not delete my account, but I have not posted or read for a long time. I've found my home at Mastodon.<br />3. I started a blog!¬†\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2><strong>Goals for 2025</strong></h2>\n\n1. 20+ books, a wide variety of genres, and if the book is noteworthy, blog about it. I'm considering an outline like Key Points, Personal Impact, and Action Items. \n<br />\n2. Stay healthy; eat even better, train more, reduce stress, smile more, and look at the bright side. <em>(in your fifties, your check engine light comes on, and the sins of youth come back to haunt you.)</em>\n<br />\n3. Start some sort of music outlet. Pick an instrument and take some lessons. \n<br />\n4. Save. Save. Save. Retirement is just around the corner. \n<br />\n5. Keep searching for that perfect <em>(adequate, best you can, clumsy, awkward)</em> Work/Life balance. \n<br />\n6. Find a new second monitor. I'm using a Studio Display as the main display, and I have a now very old 30\" Apple Cinema Display that still surprises me that it still works. It's around 17 years old. Doing a lot of tutorials and video/photo editing, the second monitor is priceless. \n<br />\n7. Read and support more small independent news sources like <a href=\"https://www.404media.co\">404 Media</a> and the numerous independent journalists on Substack. There is a wave of exodus of talent from major news outlets now that they can make a living writing on Substack, Beehiiv, Ghost, etc. That freedom to say what you want when you want has got to be refreshing. We are experiencing significant changes in mainstream media, and I believe 2025 will be a very tumultuous year. <hr />\n<br />Where do you stop with this stuff, I could futz with this post for weeks. It's gotta end somewhere. This is the end. Here is to an Amazing 2025. <em>(please, please, please, don't let America self-implode; it's only December, and they are already off to a rocky start...

On it, everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor, and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every 'superstar,' every 'supreme leader,' every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there ‚Äî on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam. The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment, the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.‚Äù ¬†\n\n~ Carl Sagan</blockquote>\n\n\n",
